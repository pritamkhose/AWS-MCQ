The system was also down for 4 hours while the Systems Operators manually performed these processes.What architectural changes will minimize downtime and reduce the chance of lost data?", "Suggested Answer:\nB \n\n                                        Reference:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html"], "que_header": "<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 398<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>", "ans": "Suggested Answer:\nB ", "ans_details": "\n                                        Reference:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html\n                                    "}, {"name": "Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate SAA-C02 topic 1 question 291 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/43796-exam-aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02/", "reply": "15", "views": "2767", "username": "toto059", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            tinyshare\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 4Â hours, 2Â minutes ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate SAA-C02\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 291<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate SAA-C02 Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"690731\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">A solutions architect is creating a new VPC design.

There is concern that this function may impact other criticalLambda functions due to Lambdaג€™s regional concurrency limit.How can the solutions architect ensure this new Lambda function will not impact other critical Lambda functions?", "Suggested Answer:\nA"], "que_header": "<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 679<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>", "ans": "Suggested Answer:\nA ", "ans_details": "\n"}, {"name": "Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional topic 1 question 678 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/36443-exam-aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional-topic-1/", "reply": "34", "views": "2129", "username": "liono", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            tvs\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 2Â weeks, 2Â days ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 678<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"675381\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">A solutions architect is designing a disaster recovery strategy for a three-tier application.

Scaling actions are performed automatically as a function of time and date.Reference:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/schedule_time.html\n                                    "}, {"name": "Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional topic 1 question 233 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/55345-exam-aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional-topic-1/", "reply": "1", "views": "32", "username": "bamjive06", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            bamjive06\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 2Â weeks, 2Â days ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 233<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"674936\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">True or False: The Amazon ElastiCache clusters are not available for use in VPC at this time.<br/></p>\n<div class=\"question-choices-container\">\n<ul>\n<li class=\"multi-choice-item\">\n<span class=\"multi-choice-letter\">\n                                                        A.\n                                                    </span>\n                                                    \n                                                    TRUE\n                                                </li>\n<li class=\"multi-choice-item\">\n<span class=\"multi-choice-letter\">\n                                                        B.\n                                                    </span>\n                                                    \n                                                    True, but they are available only in the GovCloud.\n                                                </li>\n<li class=\"multi-choice-item\">\n<span class=\"multi-choice-letter\">\n                                                        C.\n                                                    </span>\n                                                    \n                                                    True, but they are available only on request\n                                                </li>\n<li class=\"multi-choice-item correct-hidden\">\n<span class=\"multi-choice-letter\">\n                                                        D.\n                                                    </span>\n                                                    \n                                                    FALSE\n                                                </li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<a class=\"btn btn-primary reveal-solution\" href=\"#\">Show Suggested Answer</a>\n<a class=\"btn btn-primary hide-solution d-none\" href=\"#\">Hide Answer</a>\n<p class=\"card-text question-answer bg-light white-text\">\n<span class=\"correct-answer-box\"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong>\n<span class=\"correct-answer\">D</span> <br/></span>\n<span class=\"answer-description\">\n                                        Amazon Elasticache clusters can be run in an Amazon VPC.

There are separate permissions for the use of a CMK that provides added protection against unauthorized access of your objects in Amazon S3. SSE-KMS also provides you with an audit trail that shows when your CMK was used and by whom.\"Server-Side Encryption: Using SSE-KMSYou can protect data at rest in Amazon S3 by using three different modes of server-side encryption: SSE-S3, SSE-C, or SSE-KMS.SSE-S3 requires that Amazon S3 manage the data and master encryption keys.

Its function is to check for network interfaces that have not been configured and configure them.Reference:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-eni.html\n                                    "}, {"name": "Exam AWS-SysOps topic 1 question 898 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/52039-exam-aws-sysops-topic-1-question-898-discussion/", "reply": "3", "views": "206", "username": "binhdt2611", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            TroyMcLure\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 2Â weeks, 2Â days ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-sysops/\">\n                                    AWS-SysOps\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 898<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-sysops/\">\n                                    [All AWS-SysOps Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"705400\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">A company wants to launch a group of Amazon EC2 instances that need to communicate with each other with the lowest possible latency.<br/>Which combination of actions should a SysOps administrator take when launching these instances?

You can then also establish a VPN connection to your VPC in the remote region.Any data transfer out of a remote region is billed at the remote region data transfer rate.Reference:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/latest/UserGuide/remote_regions.html\n                                    "}, {"name": "Exam AWS-SysOps topic 1 question 685 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/7275-exam-aws-sysops-topic-1-question-685-discussion/", "reply": "25", "views": "2357", "username": "saumenP", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            Bigdss\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 2Â weeks, 2Â days ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-sysops/\">\n                                    AWS-SysOps\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 685<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-sysops/\">\n                                    [All AWS-SysOps Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"705187\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">After launching a new Amazon EC2 instance from a Microsoft Windows 2012 Amazon Machine Image (AMI), the SysOps Administrator is unable to connect to the instance using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).

These hosted virtual interfaces work the same as standard virtual interfaces and can connect to public resources or a VPC.Reference:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/latest/UserGuide/WorkingWithVirtualInterfaces.html\n                                    "}, {"name": "Exam ANS-C00 topic 1 question 287 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/45257-exam-ans-c00-topic-1-question-287-discussion/", "reply": "6", "views": "104", "username": "Huntkey", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            ptpho\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 2Â weeks, 3Â days ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/ans-c00/\">\n                                    ANS-C00\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 287<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/ans-c00/\">\n                                    [All ANS-C00 Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"603124\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">Your VPC has a DX connection that is advertising 99 routes.

Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can detect when an instance is unhealthy, terminate it, and launch an instance to replace it. You can also configure Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to use multiple Availability Zones. If one Availability Zone becomes unavailable, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can launch instances in another one to compensate.Better availability. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling helps ensure that your application always has the right amount of capacity to handle the current traffic demand.Better cost management. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can dynamically increase and decrease capacity as needed. Because you pay for the EC2 instances you use, you save money by launching instances when they are needed and terminating them when they aren't.Reference:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/how-it-works.html#how-it-works-ec2 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/auto-scaling-benefits.html\n
