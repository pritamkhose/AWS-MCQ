The default namespace for metrics collected by the CloudWatch agent is CWAgent, although you can specify a different namespace when you configure the agent.The logs collected by the unified CloudWatch agent are processed and stored in Amazon CloudWatch Logs, just like logs collected by the older CloudWatch Logs agent.Reference:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Install-CloudWatch-Agent.html\n                                    "}, {"name": "Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate topic 2 question 9 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/8127-exam-aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-topic-2/", "reply": "29", "views": "9554", "username": "ExamPrep", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            Ankitrathi85\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 4Â months, 1Â week ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 9<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 2\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"474758\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">A Solutions Architect is reviewing an application that writes data to an Amazon DynamoDB table on a daily basis.

You can create scheduled actions that scale one time only or that scale on a recurring schedule.Reference:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-fleet-scheduled-scaling.html\n                                    "}, {"name": "Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate topic 2 question 4 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/8114-exam-aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-topic-2/", "reply": "17", "views": "7362", "username": "ExamPrep", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            Ankitrathi85\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 4Â months, 1Â week ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 4<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 2\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"474753\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">An online retailer has a series of flash sales occurring every Friday.

The public facing interface, which may or may not be behind a load balancer, has an associated security group to allow access to the server from the internet while the private facing interface has an associated security group allowing SSH access only from an allowed range of IP addresses either within the VPC or from the internet, a private subnet within the VPC or a virtual private gateway.Reference:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-eni.html\n                                    "}, {"name": "Exam AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner topic 1 question 216 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/18126-exam-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-topic-1-question-216/", "reply": "13", "views": "3559", "username": "GJO", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            Maxelyne\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 4Â months, 1Â week ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 216<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"704047\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">What is an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role?<br/></p>\n<div class=\"question-choices-container\">\n<ul>\n<li class=\"multi-choice-item\">\n<span class=\"multi-choice-letter\">\n                                                        A.\n                                                    </span>\n                                                    \n                                                    A user associated with an AWS resource\n                                                </li>\n<li class=\"multi-choice-item\">\n<span class=\"multi-choice-letter\">\n                                                        B.\n                                                    </span>\n                                                    \n                                                    A group associated with an AWS resource\n                                                </li>\n<li class=\"multi-choice-item correct-hidden\">\n<span class=\"multi-choice-letter\">\n                                                        C.\n                                                    </span>\n                                                    \n                                                    An entity that defines a set of permissions for use with an AWS resource\n                                                </li>\n<li class=\"multi-choice-item\">\n<span class=\"multi-choice-letter\">\n                                                        D.\n                                                    </span>\n                                                    \n                                                    An authentication credential associated with a multi-factor authentication (MFA) token\n                                                </li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<a class=\"btn btn-primary reveal-solution\" href=\"#\">Show Suggested Answer</a>\n<a class=\"btn btn-primary hide-solution d-none\" href=\"#\">Hide Answer</a>\n<p class=\"card-text question-answer bg-light white-text\">\n<span class=\"correct-answer-box\"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong>\n<span class=\"correct-answer\">C</span> <br/></span>\n<span class=\"answer-description\">\n                                        AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) enables you to manage access to AWS services and resources securely.

However, we strongly recommend that you do not embed or distribute long-term AWS credentials with apps that a user downloads to a device, even in an encrypted store. Instead, build your app so that it requests temporary AWS security credentials dynamically when needed using web identity federation. The supplied temporary credentials map to an AWS role that has only the permissions needed to perform the tasks required by the mobile app.<br/>With web identity federation, you don't need to create custom sign-in code or manage your own user identities.<br/>Instead, users of your app can sign in using a well-known identity provider (IdP) such as Login with Amazon,<br/><br/>Facebook, Google, or any other -<br/>OpenID Connect (OIDC)<br/>-compatible IdP, receive an authentication token, and<br/>then exchange that token for temporary security credentials in AWS that map to an IAM role with permissions to use the resources in your AWS account. Using an IdP helps you keep your AWS account secure, because you don't have to embed and distribute long-term security credentials with your application.<br/>For most scenarios, we recommend that you use<br/><br/>Amazon Cognito -<br/>because it acts as an identity broker and<br/>does much of the federation work for you. For details, see the following section,<br/><br/>Using Amazon Cognito for -<br/><br/>Mobile Apps -<br/>.<br/>If you don't use Amazon Cognito, then you must write code that interacts with a web IdP (Login with Amazon,<br/>Facebook, Google, or any other OIDC-compatible IdP) and then calls the AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity API to trade the authentication token you get from those IdPs for AWS temporary security credentials. If you have already used this approach for existing apps, you can continue to use it.<br/>Using Amazon Cognito for Mobile Apps<br/>The preferred way to use web identity federation is to use<br/><br/>Amazon Cognito -<br/>. For example, Adele the developer<br/>is building a game for a mobile device where user data such as scores and profiles is stored in Amazon S3 and Amazon DynamoDB. Adele could also store this data locally on the device and use Amazon Cognito to keep it synchronized across devices. She knows that for security and maintenance reasons, long-term AWS security credentials should not be distributed with the game. She also knows that the game might have a large number of users. For all of these reasons, she does not want to create new user identities in IAM for each player. Instead, she builds the game so that users can sign in using an identity that they've already established with a well-known identity provider, such as Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google, or any OpenID Connect<br/>(OIDC)-compatible identity provider. Her game can take advantage of the authentication mechanism from one of these providers to validate the user's identity.<br/>To enable the mobile app to access her AWS resources, Adele first registers for a developer ID with her chosen IdPs. She also configures the application with each of these providers. In her AWS account that contains the Amazon S3 bucket and DynamoDB table for the game, Adele uses Amazon Cognito to create<br/>IAM roles that precisely define permissions that the game needs. If she is using an OIDC IdP, she also creates an IAM OIDC identity provider entity to establish trust between her AWS account and the IdP.<br/>In the app's code, Adele calls the sign-in interface for the IdP that she configured previously. The IdP handles all the details of letting the user sign in, and the app gets an OAuth access token or OIDC ID token from the provider. Adele's app can trade this authentication information for a set of temporary security credentials that consist of an AWS access key ID, a secret access key, and a session token.

Users will log into the game using their existing social media account to streamline data capture. Company B would like to directly save player data and scoring information from the mobile app to a DynamoDS table named Score Data When a user saves their game the progress data will be stored to the Game state S3 bucket.What is the best approach for storing data to DynamoDB and S3?", "Suggested Answer:\nB \n\n                                        Web Identity Federation -Imagine that you are creating a mobile app that accesses AWS resources, such as a game that runs on a mobile device and stores player and score information using Amazon S3 and DynamoDB.When you write such an app, you'll make requests to AWS services that must be signed with an AWS access key. However, we strongly recommend that you do not embed or distribute long-term AWS credentials with apps that a user downloads to a device, even in an encrypted store. Instead, build your app so that it requests temporary AWS security credentials dynamically when needed using web identity federation. The supplied temporary credentials map to an AWS role that has only the permissions needed to perform the tasks required by the mobile app.With web identity federation, you don't need to create custom sign-in code or manage your own user identities.Instead, users of your app can sign in using a well-known identity provider (IdP) such as Login with Amazon,Facebook, Google, or any other -OpenID Connect (OIDC)-compatible IdP, receive an authentication token, andthen exchange that token for temporary security credentials in AWS that map to an IAM role with permissions to use the resources in your AWS account. Using an IdP helps you keep your AWS account secure, because you don't have to embed and distribute long-term security credentials with your application.For most scenarios, we recommend that you useAmazon Cognito -because it acts as an identity broker anddoes much of the federation work for you. For details, see the following section,Using Amazon Cognito for -Mobile Apps -.If you don't use Amazon Cognito, then you must write code that interacts with a web IdP (Login with Amazon,Facebook, Google, or any other OIDC-compatible IdP) and then calls the AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity API to trade the authentication token you get from those IdPs for AWS temporary security credentials. If you have already used this approach for existing apps, you can continue to use it.Using Amazon Cognito for Mobile AppsThe preferred way to use web identity federation is to useAmazon Cognito -. For example, Adele the developeris building a game for a mobile device where user data such as scores and profiles is stored in Amazon S3 and Amazon DynamoDB. Adele could also store this data locally on the device and use Amazon Cognito to keep it synchronized across devices. She knows that for security and maintenance reasons, long-term AWS security credentials should not be distributed with the game. She also knows that the game might have a large number of users. For all of these reasons, she does not want to create new user identities in IAM for each player. Instead, she builds the game so that users can sign in using an identity that they've already established with a well-known identity provider, such as Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google, or any OpenID Connect(OIDC)-compatible identity provider. Her game can take advantage of the authentication mechanism from one of these providers to validate the user's identity.To enable the mobile app to access her AWS resources, Adele first registers for a developer ID with her chosen IdPs. She also configures the application with each of these providers. In her AWS account that contains the Amazon S3 bucket and DynamoDB table for the game, Adele uses Amazon Cognito to createIAM roles that precisely define permissions that the game needs. If she is using an OIDC IdP, she also creates an IAM OIDC identity provider entity to establish trust between her AWS account and the IdP.In the app's code, Adele calls the sign-in interface for the IdP that she configured previously. The IdP handles all the details of letting the user sign in, and the app gets an OAuth access token or OIDC ID token from the provider. Adele's app can trade this authentication information for a set of temporary security credentials that consist of an AWS access key ID, a secret access key, and a session token. The app can then use these credentials to access web services offered by AWS. The app is limited to the permissions that are defined in the role that it assumes.The following figure shows a simplified flow for how this might work, using Login with Amazon as the IdP.

The Solutions Architect has been asked to reduce the cost of the application.Which solution is MOST cost-effective?", "Suggested Answer:\nA"], "que_header": "<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 142<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 2\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>", "ans": "Suggested Answer:\nA ", "ans_details": "\n"}, {"name": "Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional topic 2 question 141 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/18133-exam-aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional-topic-2/", "reply": "24", "views": "2404", "username": "Smart", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            Kian1\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 4Â months, 2Â weeks ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 141<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 2\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"493149\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">An online e-commerce business is running a workload on AWS.

A Solutions Architect has been asked to fix existing patch deficiencies, and to develop a workflow to ensure that future patching requirements are identified and taken care of quickly. The Solutions Architect has decided to use AWS Systems Manager. It is important that EC2 instance reboots do not occur at the same time on all Windows workloads to meet organizational uptime requirements.<br/>Which workflow will meet these requirements in an automated manner?<br/></p>\n<div class=\"question-choices-container\">\n<ul>\n<li class=\"multi-choice-item\">\n<span class=\"multi-choice-letter\">\n                                                        A.\n                                                    </span>\n                                                    \n                                                    Add a Patch Group tag with a value of Windows Servers to all existing EC2 instances.

When you provision a Multi-AZ DB Instance,<br/>Amazon RDS automatically creates a primary DB Instance and synchronously replicates the data to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone (AZ). Each AZ runs on its own physically distinct, independent infrastructure, and is engineered to be highly reliable. In case of an infrastructure failure (for example, instance hardware failure, storage failure, or network disruption), Amazon RDS performs an automatic failover to the standby, so that you can resume database operations as soon as the failover is complete. Since the endpoint for your DB Instance remains the same after a failover, your application can resume database operation without the need for manual administrative intervention.<br/><br/>Benefits -<br/><br/>Enhanced Durability -<br/><br/>Multi-AZ deployments for the -<br/><br/>MySQL -<br/>,<br/><br/>Oracle -<br/>, and<br/><br/>PostgreSQL -<br/>engines utilize synchronous physical<br/>replication to keep data on the standby up-to-date with the primary. Multi-AZ deployments for the<br/><br/>SQL Server -<br/>engine use synchronous logical replication to achieve the same result, employing SQL Server-native Mirroring technology. Both approaches safeguard your data in the event of a DB Instance failure or loss of an Availability<br/>Zone.<br/>If a storage volume on your primary fails in a Multi-AZ deployment, Amazon RDS automatically initiates a failover to the up-to-date standby. Compare this to a Single-AZ deployment: in case of a Single-AZ database failure, a user-initiated point-in-time-restore operation will be required. This operation can take several hours to complete, and any data updates that occurred after the latest restorable time (typically within the last five minutes) will not be available.<br/><br/>Amazon Aurora -<br/>employs a highly durable, SSD-backed virtualized storage layer purpose-built for database workloads. Amazon Aurora automatically replicates your volume six ways, across three Availability Zones.<br/>Amazon Aurora storage is fault-tolerant, transparently handling the loss of up to two copies of data without affecting database write availability and up to three copies without affecting read availability. Amazon Aurora storage is also self-healing. Data blocks and disks are continuously scanned for errors and replaced automatically.<br/><br/>Increased Availability -<br/>You also benefit from enhanced database availability when running Multi-AZ deployments. If an Availability<br/>Zone failure or DB Instance failure occurs, your availability impact is limited to the time automatic failover takes to complete: typically under one minute for Amazon Aurora and one to two minutes for other database engines<br/>(see the<br/><br/>RDS FAQ -<br/>for details).<br/>The availability benefits of Multi-AZ deployments also extend to planned maintenance and backups. In the case of system upgrades like OS patching or DB Instance scaling, these operations are applied first on the standby, prior to the automatic failover. As a result, your availability impact is, again, only the time required for automatic failover to complete.<br/>Unlike Single-AZ deployments, I/O activity is not suspended on your primary during backup for Multi-AZ deployments for the MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL engines, because the backup is taken from the standby.<br/>However, note that you may still experience elevated latencies for a few minutes during backups for Multi-AZ deployments.<br/>On instance failure in Amazon Aurora deployments, Amazon RDS uses RDS Multi-AZ technology to automate failover to one of up to 15 Amazon Aurora Replicas you have created in any of three Availability Zones. If no<br/>Amazon Aurora Replicas have been provisioned, in the case of a failure, Amazon RDS will attempt to create a new Amazon Aurora DB instance for you automatically.<br/><br/>No Administrative Intervention -<br/>DB Instance failover is fully automatic and requires no administrative intervention.

For example, you might consider it critical to know when someone modifies the configuration of a security group, but not need to know every time there is a change to tags on your Amazon EC2 instances. Or, you might want to write a program that performs specific actions when specific resources are updated. For example, you might want to start a certain workflow when a security group configuration is changed.

If you're confident that your instance is in a consistent state appropriate for AMI creation, you can tell Amazon EC2 not to power down and reboot the instance. Some file systems, such as XFS, can freeze and unfreeze activity, making it safe to create the image without rebooting the instance.<br/>During the AMI-creation process, Amazon EC2 creates snapshots of your instance's root volume and any other EBS volumes attached to your instance.

However, in complex configurations, you use a combination of alias resource record sets<br/>(including weighted alias, latency alias, and failover alias) and nonalias resource record sets to build a decision tree that gives you greater control over how Amazon Route 53 responds to requests. For more information, see<br/>How Health Checks Work in Simple Amazon Route 53 Configurations<br/>.<br/>For example, you might use latency alias resource record sets to select a region close to a user and use weighted resource record sets for two or more resources within each region to protect against the failure of a single endpoint or an Availability Zone. The following diagram shows this configuration.<br/><img class=\"in-exam-image\" src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/02463/0002000001.png\"/><br/>Here's how Amazon EC2 and Amazon Route 53 are configured:<br/>You have Amazon EC2 instances in two regions, us-east-1 and ap-southeast-2. You want Amazon Route 53 to respond to queries by using the resource record sets in the region that provides the lowest latency for your customers, so you create a latency alias resource record set for each region. (You create the latency alias resource record sets after you create resource record sets for the individual Amazon EC2 instances.)<br/>Within each region, you have two Amazon EC2 instances. You create a weighted resource record set for each instance. The name and the type are the same for both of the weighted resource record sets in each region.<br/>When you have multiple resources in a region, you can create weighted or failover resource record sets for your resources. You can also create even more complex configurations by creating weighted alias or failover alias resource record sets that, in turn, refer to multiple resources.<br/>Each weighted resource record set has an associated health check. The IP address for each health check matches the IP address for the corresponding resource record set. This isn't required, but it's the most common configuration.<br/>For both latency alias resource record sets, you set the value of Evaluate Target Health to Yes.<br/>You use the Evaluate Target Health setting for each latency alias resource record set to make Amazon<br/>Route 53 evaluate the health of the alias targetsthe weighted resource record setsand respond accordingly.<br/><img class=\"in-exam-image\" src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/02463/0002100001.png\"/><br/>The preceding diagram illustrates the following sequence of events:<br/>Amazon Route 53 receives a query for example.com. Based on the latency for the user making the request,<br/>Amazon Route 53 selects the latency alias resource record set for the us-east-1 region.<br/>Amazon Route 53 selects a weighted resource record set based on weight. Evaluate Target Health is Yes for the latency alias resource record set, so Amazon Route 53 checks the health of the selected weighted resource record set.<br/>The health check failed, so Amazon Route 53 chooses another weighted resource record set based on weight and checks its health. That resource record set also is unhealthy.<br/>Amazon Route 53 backs out of that branch of the tree, looks for the latency alias resource record set with the next-best latency, and chooses the resource record set for ap-southeast-2.<br/>Amazon Route 53 again selects a resource record set based on weight, and then checks the health of the selected resource record set. The health check passed, so Amazon Route 53 returns the applicable value in response to the query.<br/>What Happens When You Associate a Health Check with an Alias Resource Record Set?<br/>You can associate a health check with an alias resource record set instead of or in addition to setting the value of Evaluate Target Health to Yes. However, it's generally more useful if Amazon Route 53 responds to queries based on the health of the underlying resourcesthe HTTP servers, database servers, and other resources that your alias resource record sets refer to. For example, suppose the following configuration:<br/>You assign a health check to a latency alias resource record set for which the alias target is a group of weighted resource record sets.<br/>You set the value of Evaluate Target Health to Yes for the latency alias resource record set.<br/>In this configuration, both of the following must be true before Amazon Route 53 will return the applicable value for a weighted resource record set:<br/>The health check associated with the latency alias resource record set must pass.<br/>At least one weighted resource record set must be considered healthy, either because it's associated with a health check that passes or because it's not associated with a health check. In the latter case, Amazon<br/>Route 53 always considers the weighted resource record set healthy.<br/><img class=\"in-exam-image\" src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/02463/0002200001.png\"/><br/>If the health check for the latency alias resource record set fails, Amazon Route 53 stops responding to queries using any of the weighted resource record sets in the alias target, even if they're all healthy. Amazon<br/>Route 53 doesn't know the status of the weighted resource record sets because it never looks past the failed health check on the alias resource record set.<br/>What Happens When You Omit Health Checks?<br/>In a complex configuration, it's important to associate health checks with all of the non-alias resource record sets. Let's return to the preceding example, but assume that a health check is missing on one of the weighted resource record sets in the us-east-1 region:<br/><img class=\"in-exam-image\" src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/02463/0002300001.png\"/><br/>Here's what happens when you omit a health check on a non-alias resource record set in this configuration:<br/>Amazon Route 53 receives a query for example.com. Based on the latency for the user making the request,<br/>Amazon Route 53 selects the latency alias resource record set for the us-east-1 region.<br/>Amazon Route 53 looks up the alias target for the latency alias resource record set, and checks the status of the corresponding health checks. The health check for one weighted resource record set failed, so that resource record set is omitted from consideration.<br/>The other weighted resource record set in the alias target for the us-east-1 region has no health check. The corresponding resource might or might not be healthy, but without a health check, Amazon Route 53 has no way to know. Amazon Route 53 assumes that the resource is healthy and returns the applicable value in response to the query.<br/>What Happens When You Set Evaluate Target Health to No?<br/>In general, you also want to set Evaluate Target Health to Yes for all of the alias resource record sets. In the following example, all of the weighted resource record sets have associated health checks, but Evaluate<br/>Target Health is set to No for the latency alias resource record set for the us-east-1 region:<br/><img class=\"in-exam-image\" src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/02463/0002400001.png\"/><br/>Here's what happens when you set Evaluate Target Health to No for an alias resource record set in this configuration:<br/>Amazon Route 53 receives a query for example.com.

They're both failing.Because the value of Evaluate Target Health is No for the latency alias resource record set for the us-east-1 region, Amazon Route 53 must choose one resource record set in this branch instead of backing out of the branch and looking for a healthy resource record set in the ap-southeast-2 region.\n                                    "}, {"name": "Exam AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner topic 1 question 166 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/20816-exam-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-topic-1-question-166/", "reply": "6", "views": "2057", "username": "szhman", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            bratpyt\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 4Â months, 4Â weeks ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 166<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"703997\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">What is a benefit of loose coupling as a principle of cloud architecture design?<br/></p>\n<div class=\"question-choices-container\">\n<ul>\n<li class=\"multi-choice-item\">\n<span class=\"multi-choice-letter\">\n                                                        A.\n                                                    </span>\n                                                    \n                                                    It facilitates low-latency request handling.\n                                                </li>\n<li class=\"multi-choice-item\">\n<span class=\"multi-choice-letter\">\n                                                        B.\n                                                    </span>\n                                                    \n                                                    It allows applications to have dependent workflows.\n                                                </li>\n<li class=\"multi-choice-item correct-hidden\">\n<span class=\"multi-choice-letter\">\n                                                        C.\n                                                    </span>\n                                                    \n                                                    It prevents cascading failures between different components.\n                                                </li>\n<li class=\"multi-choice-item\">\n<span class=\"multi-choice-letter\">\n                                                        D.\n                                                    </span>\n                                                    \n                                                    It allows companies to focus on their physical data center operations.\n                                                </li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<a class=\"btn btn-primary reveal-solution\" href=\"#\">Show Suggested Answer</a>\n<a class=\"btn btn-primary hide-solution d-none\" href=\"#\">Hide Answer</a>\n<p class=\"card-text question-answer bg-light white-text\">\n<span class=\"correct-answer-box\"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong>\n<span class=\"correct-answer\">C</span> <br/></span>\n<span class=\"answer-description\">\n                                        IT systems should ideally be designed in a way that reduces inter-dependencies.

The user cannot enable detailed monitoring with SNS.\n                                    "}, {"name": "Exam AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner topic 1 question 368 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/30283-exam-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-topic-1-question-368/", "reply": "4", "views": "1433", "username": "b_d", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            niyozbekkk\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 5Â months ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 368<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"704199\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">The continual reduction of AWS Cloud pricing is due to:<br/></p>\n<div class=\"question-choices-container\">\n<ul>\n<li class=\"multi-choice-item\">\n<span class=\"multi-choice-letter\">\n                                                        A.\n                                                    </span>\n                                                    \n                                                    pay-as-you go pricing\n                                                </li>\n<li class=\"multi-choice-item\">\n<span class=\"multi-choice-letter\">\n                                                        B.\n                                                    </span>\n                                                    \n                                                    the AWS global infrastructure\n                                                </li>\n<li class=\"multi-choice-item correct-hidden\">\n<span class=\"multi-choice-letter\">\n                                                        C.\n                                                    </span>\n                                                    \n                                                    economies of scale\n                                                </li>\n<li class=\"multi-choice-item\">\n<span class=\"multi-choice-letter\">\n                                                        D.\n                                                    </span>\n                                                    \n                                                    reserved storage pricing\n                                                </li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<a class=\"btn btn-primary reveal-solution\" href=\"#\">Show Suggested Answer</a>\n<a class=\"btn btn-primary hide-solution d-none\" href=\"#\">Hide Answer</a>\n<p class=\"card-text question-answer bg-light white-text\">\n<span class=\"correct-answer-box\"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong>\n<span class=\"correct-answer\">C</span> <br/></span>\n<span class=\"answer-description\">\n                                        Reference:<br/>https://read.acloud.guru/there-are-four-reasons-to-explain-how-using-aws-can-change-the-economic-model-of-the-it-services-850dcc8ea1aa?

The credentials you create for users are what they use to uniquely identi-fy themselves to AWS.Reference:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_WorkingWithGroupsAndUsers.html\n                                    "}, {"name": "Exam AWS-SysOps topic 2 question 231 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/20132-exam-aws-sysops-topic-2-question-231-discussion/", "reply": "6", "views": "1740", "username": "nicat", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            Chirantan\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 5Â months, 1Â week ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-sysops/\">\n                                    AWS-SysOps\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 231<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 2\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-sysops/\">\n                                    [All AWS-SysOps Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"533973\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">A company needs to have real-time access to image data while seamlessly maintaining a copy of the images in an offsite location.<br/>Which AWS solution would allow access to the image data locally while also providing for disaster recovery?<br/></p>\n<div class=\"question-choices-container\">\n<ul>\n<li class=\"multi-choice-item\">\n<span class=\"multi-choice-letter\">\n                                                        A.\n                                                    </span>\n                                                    \n                                                    Create an AWS Storage Gateway volume gateway configured as a stored volume.
