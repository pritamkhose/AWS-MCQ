Typically, it is information from a private TCP/IP computer network to the Internet that is controlled.Reference:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-network-security.html\n                                    "}, {"name": "Exam AWS Certified Developer Associate topic 2 question 31 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/7141-exam-aws-certified-developer-associate-topic-2-question-31/", "reply": "12", "views": "2885", "username": "HazemYousry", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            RicardoD\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 6Â months, 3Â weeks ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-developer-associate/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Developer Associate\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 31<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 2\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-developer-associate/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Developer Associate Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"405400\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">Which of the following are valid SNS delivery transports?

Additionally, if there is a disruption in service in the main region, traffic should be automatically routed to the secondary region, and the secondary region must be able to scale up to handle all traffic.<br/>How should a DevOps Engineer meet these requirements?<br/></p>\n<div class=\"question-choices-container\">\n<ul>\n<li class=\"multi-choice-item correct-hidden\">\n<span class=\"multi-choice-letter\">\n                                                        A.\n                                                    </span>\n                                                    \n                                                    In both regions, deploy the application on AWS Elastic Beanstalk and use Amazon DynamoDB global tables for session data.

                AWS Direct Connect lets you establish a dedicated network connection between your network and one of the AWS Direct Connect locations.

The snapshots are asynchronous and incremental.\n                                    "}, {"name": "Exam AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner topic 1 question 208 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/19481-exam-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-topic-1-question-208/", "reply": "5", "views": "2811", "username": "mfmf1", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            RAAAEHL\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 7Â months, 1Â week ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 208<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"704039\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">Which AWS service would a customer use with a static website to achieve lower latency and high transfer speeds?<br/></p>\n<div class=\"question-choices-container\">\n<ul>\n<li class=\"multi-choice-item\">\n<span class=\"multi-choice-letter\">\n                                                        A.\n                                                    </span>\n                                                    \n                                                    AWS Lambda\n                                                </li>\n<li class=\"multi-choice-item\">\n<span class=\"multi-choice-letter\">\n                                                        B.\n                                                    </span>\n                                                    \n                                                    Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator\n                                                </li>\n<li class=\"multi-choice-item\">\n<span class=\"multi-choice-letter\">\n                                                        C.\n                                                    </span>\n                                                    \n                                                    Amazon Route 53\n                                                </li>\n<li class=\"multi-choice-item correct-hidden\">\n<span class=\"multi-choice-letter\">\n                                                        D.\n                                                    </span>\n                                                    \n                                                    Amazon CloudFront\n                                                </li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<a class=\"btn btn-primary reveal-solution\" href=\"#\">Show Suggested Answer</a>\n<a class=\"btn btn-primary hide-solution d-none\" href=\"#\">Hide Answer</a>\n<p class=\"card-text question-answer bg-light white-text\">\n<span class=\"correct-answer-box\"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong>\n<span class=\"correct-answer\">D</span> <br/></span>\n<span class=\"answer-description\">\n                                        Amazon CloudFront is a fast content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to customers globally with low latency, high transfer speeds, all within a developer-friendly environment.

CloudFront speeds up content delivery by leveraging its global network of data centers, known as edge locations, to reduce delivery time by caching your content close to your end users. CloudFront fetches your content from an origin, such as an Amazon S3 bucket, an Amazon EC2 instance, an Amazon Elastic Load Balancing load balancer or your own web server, when it's not already in an edge location. CloudFront can be used to deliver your entire website or application, including dynamic, static, streaming, and interactive content.<br/>Reference:<br/>https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/tutorials/deliver-content-faster/\n                                    </span>\n</p>\n</div>\n<!-- / Question  -->\n<div class=\"discussion-meta-data mt-3 pt-1 border-top\">\n                                    by\n                                    \n                                    <a class=\"title-username\" href=\"/user/szhman/\" style=\"\">\n<i class=\"fa fa-user-o\"></i>\n                                        szhman\n                                    </a>\n                                    \n                                    at <i>\n                                    May 18, 2020, 8:19 a.m.</i>\n</div>\n</div>", "que": ["Which solution provides the FASTEST application response times to frequently accessed data to users in multiple AWS Regions?", "Suggested Answer:\nB \n\n                                        You can deliver content and decrease end-user latency of your web application using Amazon CloudFront.

It seamlessly integrates on-premises enterprise applications and workflows with Amazonג€™s block and object cloud storage services through industry standard storage protocols. It provides low-latency performance by caching frequently accessed data on premises, while storing data securely and durably in Amazon cloud storage services.

However, by running two separate environments simultaneously, you will obviously incur much higher costs.Reference:https://cloudranger.com/best-practices-aws-disaster-recovery-planning/\n                                    "}, {"name": "Exam AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner topic 1 question 147 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/18588-exam-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-topic-1-question-147/", "reply": "3", "views": "3047", "username": "Jaydox", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            RAAAEHL\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 7Â months, 1Â week ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 147<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"703978\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">What function do security groups serve related to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance security?<br/></p>\n<div class=\"question-choices-container\">\n<ul>\n<li class=\"multi-choice-item correct-hidden\">\n<span class=\"multi-choice-letter\">\n                                                        A.\n                                                    </span>\n                                                    \n                                                    Act as a virtual firewall for the Amazon EC2 instance.\n                                                </li>\n<li class=\"multi-choice-item\">\n<span class=\"multi-choice-letter\">\n                                                        B.\n                                                    </span>\n                                                    \n                                                    Secure AWS user accounts with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies.\n                                                </li>\n<li class=\"multi-choice-item\">\n<span class=\"multi-choice-letter\">\n                                                        C.\n                                                    </span>\n                                                    \n                                                    Provide DDoS protection with AWS Shield.\n                                                </li>\n<li class=\"multi-choice-item\">\n<span class=\"multi-choice-letter\">\n                                                        D.\n                                                    </span>\n                                                    \n                                                    Use Amazon CloudFront to protect the Amazon EC2 instance.\n                                                </li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<a class=\"btn btn-primary reveal-solution\" href=\"#\">Show Suggested Answer</a>\n<a class=\"btn btn-primary hide-solution d-none\" href=\"#\">Hide Answer</a>\n<p class=\"card-text question-answer bg-light white-text\">\n<span class=\"correct-answer-box\"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong>\n<span class=\"correct-answer\">A</span> <br/></span>\n<span class=\"answer-description\">\n                                        AWS Security Groups act like a firewall for your Amazon EC2 instances controlling both inbound and outbound traffic.

It provides a high-bandwidth backbone to the AWS infrastructure and is ideal for latency-sensitive applications, for example machine learning.Reference:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html\n                                    "}, {"name": "Exam AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner topic 1 question 134 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/19077-exam-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-topic-1-question-134/", "reply": "4", "views": "1718", "username": "gerben", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            RAAAEHL\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 7Â months, 1Â week ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 134<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"703965\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">Which AWS IAM feature is used to associate a set of permissions with multiple users?<br/></p>\n<div class=\"question-choices-container\">\n<ul>\n<li class=\"multi-choice-item\">\n<span class=\"multi-choice-letter\">\n                                                        A.\n                                                    </span>\n                                                    \n                                                    Multi-factor authentication\n                                                </li>\n<li class=\"multi-choice-item correct-hidden\">\n<span class=\"multi-choice-letter\">\n                                                        B.\n                                                    </span>\n                                                    \n                                                    Groups\n                                                </li>\n<li class=\"multi-choice-item\">\n<span class=\"multi-choice-letter\">\n                                                        C.\n                                                    </span>\n                                                    \n                                                    Password policies\n                                                </li>\n<li class=\"multi-choice-item\">\n<span class=\"multi-choice-letter\">\n                                                        D.\n                                                    </span>\n                                                    \n                                                    Access keys\n                                                </li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<a class=\"btn btn-primary reveal-solution\" href=\"#\">Show Suggested Answer</a>\n<a class=\"btn btn-primary hide-solution d-none\" href=\"#\">Hide Answer</a>\n<p class=\"card-text question-answer bg-light white-text\">\n<span class=\"correct-answer-box\"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong>\n<span class=\"correct-answer\">B</span> <br/></span>\n<span class=\"answer-description\">\n                                        An IAM group is a collection of IAM users.

Serverless platform includes: AWS lambda, Amazon S3, DynamoDB, API gateway, Amazon SNS, AWS step functions, Amazon kinesis and developing tools and services.Reference:https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/\n                                    "}, {"name": "Exam AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner topic 1 question 130 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/14985-exam-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-topic-1-question-130/", "reply": "3", "views": "4455", "username": "Phumy", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            RAAAEHL\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 7Â months, 1Â week ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 130<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"703961\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">An administrator needs to rapidly deploy a popular IT solution and start using it immediately.<br/>Where can the administrator find assistance?<br/></p>\n<div class=\"question-choices-container\">\n<ul>\n<li class=\"multi-choice-item\">\n<span class=\"multi-choice-letter\">\n                                                        A.\n                                                    </span>\n                                                    \n                                                    AWS Well-Architected Framework documentation\n                                                </li>\n<li class=\"multi-choice-item\">\n<span class=\"multi-choice-letter\">\n                                                        B.\n                                                    </span>\n                                                    \n                                                    Amazon CloudFront\n                                                </li>\n<li class=\"multi-choice-item\">\n<span class=\"multi-choice-letter\">\n                                                        C.\n                                                    </span>\n                                                    \n                                                    AWS CodeCommit\n                                                </li>\n<li class=\"multi-choice-item correct-hidden\">\n<span class=\"multi-choice-letter\">\n                                                        D.\n                                                    </span>\n                                                    \n                                                    AWS Quick Start reference deployments\n                                                </li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<a class=\"btn btn-primary reveal-solution\" href=\"#\">Show Suggested Answer</a>\n<a class=\"btn btn-primary hide-solution d-none\" href=\"#\">Hide Answer</a>\n<p class=\"card-text question-answer bg-light white-text\">\n<span class=\"correct-answer-box\"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong>\n<span class=\"correct-answer\">D</span> <br/></span>\n<span class=\"answer-description\">\n                                        Quick Starts are built by AWS solutions architects and partners to help you deploy popular technologies on AWS, based on AWS best practices for security and high availability.

Experts should also be able to access other AWS services, as needed.How can the Engineer implement a solution to meet these requirements with the LEAST amount of overhead?", "Suggested Answer:\nB"], "que_header": "<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-devops-engineer-professional/\">\n                                    AWS DevOps Engineer Professional\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 124<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-devops-engineer-professional/\">\n                                    [All AWS DevOps Engineer Professional Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>", "ans": "Suggested Answer:\nB ", "ans_details": "\n"}, {"name": "Exam AWS DevOps Engineer Professional topic 1 question 123 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/8535-exam-aws-devops-engineer-professional-topic-1-question-123/", "reply": "12", "views": "2228", "username": "BeastX", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            jackdryan\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 7Â months, 1Â week ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-devops-engineer-professional/\">\n                                    AWS DevOps Engineer Professional\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 123<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-devops-engineer-professional/\">\n                                    [All AWS DevOps Engineer Professional Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"675576\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">A DevOps Engineer is building a multi-stage pipeline with AWS CodePipeline to build, verify, stage, test, and deploy an application.

In such cases, a GSI can be very useful in efficiently locating items that have an uncommon attribute.Reference: https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/faqs/\n                                    "}, {"name": "Exam AWS Certified Security - Specialty topic 1 question 14 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/1646-exam-aws-certified-security-specialty-topic-1-question-14/", "reply": "3", "views": "971", "username": "kakashi", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            stt\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 7Â months, 1Â week ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-security-specialty/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Security - Specialty\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 14<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-security-specialty/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Security - Specialty Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"405437\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">An organization is using Amazon CloudWatch Logs with agents deployed on its Linux Amazon EC2 instances.<br/>The agent configuration files have been checked and the application log files to be pushed are configured correctly.
