In one of the VPCs, the company hosts an Amazon EC2 instance working as an FTP server that is contacted by a high number of clients from multiple locations.

It assigns the storage class to an object when it is written to Amazon S3. You can assign objects a specific storage class<br/>(standard or reduced redundancy) only when you write the objects to an Amazon S3 bucket or when you copy objects that are already stored in Amazon S3. Standard is the default storage class. For information about storage classes, see<br/><br/>Object Key and Metadata -<br/>.<br/>In order to reduce storage costs, you can use reduced redundancy storage for noncritical, reproducible data at lower levels of redundancy than Amazon S3 provides with standard storage. The lower level of redundancy results in less durability and availability, but in many cases, the lower costs can make reduced redundancy storage an acceptable storage solution. For example, it can be a cost-effective solution for sharing media content that is durably stored elsewhere. It can also make sense if you are storing thumbnails and other resized images that can be easily reproduced from an original image.<br/>Reduced redundancy storage is designed to provide 99.99% durability of objects over a given year. This durability level corresponds to an average annual expected loss of 0.01% of objects. For example, if you store<br/>10,000 objects using the RRS option, you can, on average, expect to incur an annual loss of a single object per year (0.01% of 10,000 objects).<br/>Note:<br/>This annual loss represents an expected average and does not guarantee the loss of less than 0.01% of objects in a given year.<br/>Reduced redundancy storage stores objects on multiple devices across multiple facilities, providing 400 times the durability of a typical disk drive, but it does not replicate objects as many times as Amazon S3 standard storage. In addition, reduced redundancy storage is designed to sustain the loss of data in a single facility.<br/>If an object in reduced redundancy storage has been lost, Amazon S3 will return a 405 error on requests made to that object. Amazon S3 also offers notifications for reduced redundancy storage object loss: you can configure your bucket so that when Amazon S3 detects the loss of an RRS object, a notification will be sent through Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS). You can then replace the lost object. To enable notifications, you can use the Amazon S3 console to set the Notifications property of your bucket.<br/><img class=\"in-exam-image\" src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/02463/0003200001.png\"/>\n</span>\n</p>\n</div>\n<!-- / Question  -->\n<div class=\"discussion-meta-data mt-3 pt-1 border-top\">\n                                    by\n                                    \n                                    <a class=\"title-username\" href=\"/user/Warrenn/\" style=\"\">\n<i class=\"fa fa-user-o\"></i>\n                                        Warrenn\n                                    </a>\n                                    \n                                    at <i>\n                                    Oct. 25, 2019, 6:03 p.m.</i>\n</div>\n</div>", "que": ["Your department creates regular analytics reports from your company's log files All log data is collected inAmazon S3 and processed by daily Amazon Elastic MapReduce (EMR) jobs that generate daily PDF reports and aggregated tables in CSV format for an Amazon Redshift data warehouse.Your CFO requests that you optimize the cost structure for this system.Which of the following alternatives will lower costs without compromising average performance of the system or data integrity for the raw data?", "Suggested Answer:\nC \n\n                                        Using Reduced Redundancy Storage Amazon S3 stores objects according to their storage class.

To improve performance you recently added a single-node Memcached ElastiCache Cluster to cache frequent DB query results. In the next weeks the overall workload is expected to grow by 30%.<br/>Do you need to change anything in the architecture to maintain the high availability or the application with the anticipated additional load?

In most apps, you have hot spots of data that are regularly queried, but only updated periodically. Think of the front page of a blog or news site, or the top 100 leaderboard in an online game. In this type of case, your app can receive dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of requests for the same data before it's updated again.<br/>Having your caching layer handle these queries has several advantages. First, it's considerably cheaper to add an in-memory cache than to scale up to a larger database cluster. Second, an in-memory cache is also easier to scale out, because it's easier to distribute an in-memory cache horizontally than a relational database.<br/>Last, a caching layer provides a request buffer in the event of a sudden spike in usage. If your app or game ends up on the front page of Reddit or the App Store, it's not unheard of to see a spike that is 10 to 100 times your normal application load. Even if you autoscale your application instances, a 10x request spike will likely make your database very unhappy.<br/>Let's focus on ElastiCache for Memcached first, because it is the best fit for a cachingfocused solution. We'll revisit Redis later in the paper, and weigh its advantages and disadvantages.<br/>Architecture with ElastiCache for Memcached -<br/>When you deploy an ElastiCache Memcached cluster, it sits in your application as a separate tier alongside your database. As mentioned previously, Amazon ElastiCache does not directly communicate with your database tier, or indeed have any particular knowledge of your database. A simplified deployment for a web application looks something like this:<br/><img class=\"in-exam-image\" src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/02463/0000800001.jpg\"/><br/>In this architecture diagram, the Amazon EC2 application instances are in an Auto Scaling group, located behind a load balancer using Elastic Load Balancing, which distributes requests among the instances. As requests come into a given EC2 instance, that EC2 instance is responsible for communicating with<br/>ElastiCache and the database tier. For development purposes, you can begin with a single ElastiCache node to test your application, and then scale to additional cluster nodes by modifying the ElastiCache cluster. As you add additional cache nodes, the EC2 application instances are able to distribute cache keys across multiple<br/>ElastiCache nodes. The most common practice is to use client-side sharding to distribute keys across cache nodes, which we will discuss later in this paper.<br/><img class=\"in-exam-image\" src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/02463/0000900001.jpg\"/><br/>When you launch an ElastiCache cluster, you can choose the Availability Zone(s) that the cluster lives in. For best performance, you should configure your cluster to use the same Availability Zones as your application servers. To launch an ElastiCache cluster in a specific Availability Zone, make sure to specify the Preferred<br/>Zone(s) option during cache cluster creation. The Availability Zones that you specify will be where ElastiCache will launch your cache nodes. We recommend that you select Spread Nodes Across Zones, which tells<br/>ElastiCache to distribute cache nodes across these zones as evenly as possible. This distribution will mitigate the impact of an Availability Zone disruption on your ElastiCache nodes. The trade-off is that some of the requests from your application to ElastiCache will go to a node in a different Availability Zone, meaning latency will be slightly higher. For more details, refer to Creating a Cache Cluster in the Amazon ElastiCache User<br/>Guide.<br/>As mentioned at the outset, ElastiCache can be coupled with a wide variety of databases. Here is an example architecture that uses Amazon DynamoDB instead of Amazon RDS and MySQL:<br/><img class=\"in-exam-image\" src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/02463/0001000001.jpg\"/><br/>This combination of DynamoDB and ElastiCache is very popular with mobile and game companies, because<br/>DynamoDB allows for higher write throughput at lower cost than traditional relational databases. In addition,<br/>DynamoDB uses a key-value access pattern similar to ElastiCache, which also simplifies the programming model. Instead of using relational SQL for the primary database but then key-value patterns for the cache, both the primary database and cache can be programmed similarly. In this architecture pattern, DynamoDB remains the source of truth for data, but application reads are offloaded to ElastiCache for a speed boost.\n                                    </span>\n</p>\n</div>\n<!-- / Question  -->\n<div class=\"discussion-meta-data mt-3 pt-1 border-top\">\n                                    by\n                                    \n                                    <a class=\"title-username\" href=\"/user/chandler/\" style=\"\">\n<i class=\"fa fa-user-o\"></i>\n                                        chandler\n                                    </a>\n                                    \n                                    at <i>\n                                    Dec. 28, 2019, 3:06 a.m.</i>\n</div>\n</div>", "que": ["Your application is using an ELB in front of an Auto Scaling group of web/application servers deployed across two AZs and a Multi-AZ RDS Instance for data persistence.The database CPU is often above 80% usage and 90% of I/O operations on the database are reads.

If the user wants to connect VPC from his own data center, he can setup a public and VPN only subnet which uses hardware VPN access to connect with his data center. When the user has configured this setup with Wizard, it will create a virtual private gateway to route all traffic of the VPN subnet. If the virtual private gateway is attached with VPC and the user deletes the VPC from the console it will first detach the gateway automatically and only then delete the VPC.\n                                    </span>\n</p>\n</div>\n<!-- / Question  -->\n<div class=\"discussion-meta-data mt-3 pt-1 border-top\">\n                                    by\n                                    \n                                    <a class=\"title-username\" href=\"/user/awsnoob/\" style=\"\">\n<i class=\"fa fa-user-o\"></i>\n                                        awsnoob\n                                    </a>\n                                    \n                                    at <i>\n                                    Dec. 12, 2019, 7:36 a.m.</i>\n</div>\n</div>", "que": ["A user has created a VPC with CIDR 20.0.0.0/16 using the wizard.

You deploy a single EC2 instance running proxy software and configure It to accept traffic from all subnets and EC2 instances in the VPC. You configure the proxy to only pass through traffic to domains that you define in its whitelist configuration. You have a nightly maintenance window or 10 minutes where all instances fetch new software updates. Each update Is about 200MB In size and there are 500 instances In the VPC that routinely fetch updates.

The EC2 instance is EBS-Optimized and supports 500 Mbps throughput between EC2 and EBS. The four EBS volumes are configured as a single RAID 0 device, and each Provisioned IOPS volume is provisioned with 4,000 IOPS<br/>(4,000 16KB reads or writes), for a total of 16,000 random IOPS on the instance. The EC2 instance initially delivers the expected 16,000 IOPS random read and write performance.

Serverless platform includes: AWS lambda, Amazon S3, DynamoDB, API gateway, Amazon SNS, AWS step functions, Amazon kinesis and developing tools and services.Reference:https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/\n                                    "}, {"name": "Exam AWS Certified Security - Specialty topic 1 question 120 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/16946-exam-aws-certified-security-specialty-topic-1-question-120/", "reply": "8", "views": "1566", "username": "awssecuritynewbie", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            erezhazan1\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 6Â months ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-security-specialty/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Security - Specialty\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 120<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-security-specialty/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Security - Specialty Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"674135\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">A Security Engineer is defining the logging solution for a newly developed product.

This method works well in domains where explicit ratings or implicit user actions can be gathered and analyzed.Reference:https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/building-a-recommendation-engine-with-spark-ml-on-amazon-emr-using-zeppelin/\n                                    "}, {"name": "Exam AWS Certified Machine Learning - Specialty topic 1 question 52 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/8382-exam-aws-certified-machine-learning-specialty-topic-1/", "reply": "10", "views": "2244", "username": "DonaldCMLIN", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            kalyanvarma\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 6Â months, 1Â week ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-machine-learning-specialty/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Machine Learning - Specialty\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 52<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-machine-learning-specialty/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Machine Learning - Specialty Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"632962\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">A financial services company is building a robust serverless data lake on Amazon S3.

The user can create it manually and attach it with a VPN only subnet.\n                                    "}, {"name": "Exam AWS Certified Developer Associate topic 2 question 54 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/10595-exam-aws-certified-developer-associate-topic-2-question-54/", "reply": "24", "views": "3243", "username": "aws_Tamilan", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            lydia_young\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 6Â months, 2Â weeks ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-developer-associate/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Developer Associate\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 54<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 2\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-developer-associate/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Developer Associate Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"405423\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">Which of the following items are required to allow an application deployed on an EC2 instance to write data to a DynamoDB table?<br/>Assume that no security Keys are allowed to be stored on the EC2 instance.
