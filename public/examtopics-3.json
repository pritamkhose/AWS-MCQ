SQS eliminates the complexity and overhead associated with managing and operating message oriented middleware, and empowers developers to focus on differentiating work.

Standard queues offer maximum throughput, best-effort ordering, and at-least-once delivery. SQS FIFO queues are designed to guarantee that messages are processed exactly once, in the exact order that they are sent.<br/><br/>Scaling Based on Amazon SQS -<br/>There are some scenarios where you might think about scaling in response to activity in an Amazon SQS queue. For example, suppose that you have a web app that lets users upload images and use them online. In this scenario, each image requires resizing and encoding before it can be published. The app runs on EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group, and it's configured to handle your typical upload rates. Unhealthy instances are terminated and replaced to maintain current instance levels at all times. The app places the raw bitmap data of the images in an SQS queue for processing. It processes the images and then publishes the processed images where they can be viewed by users. The architecture for this scenario works well if the number of image uploads doesn't vary over time.

But if the number of uploads changes over time, you might consider using dynamic scaling to scale the capacity of your Auto Scaling group.Reference:https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/#:~:text=Amazon%20SQS%20leverages%20the%20AWS,queues%20provide%20nearly%20unlimited%20throughput https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-using-sqs-queue.html\n                                    "}, {"name": "Exam AWS Certified Data Analytics - Specialty topic 1 question 84 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/51704-exam-aws-certified-data-analytics-specialty-topic-1-question/", "reply": "7", "views": "332", "username": "VikG12", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            Huy\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 6Â days, 20Â hours ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-data-analytics-specialty/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Data Analytics - Specialty\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 84<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-data-analytics-specialty/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Data Analytics - Specialty Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"673629\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">A telecommunications company is looking for an anomaly-detection solution to identify fraudulent calls.

It is not useful to connect (RDP / SSH) with an instance.Reference:http://aws.amazon.com/articles/1233/\n                                    "}, {"name": "Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate SAA-C02 topic 1 question 262 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/35820-exam-aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02/", "reply": "31", "views": "5442", "username": "sadhou2004", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            joshua08\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 1Â week ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate SAA-C02\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 262<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate SAA-C02 Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"690702\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">A company has an on-premises MySQL database used by the global sales team with infrequent access patterns.

Then you can set weights to choose how much traffic is routed to each endpoint.<br/>Endpoints in AWS Global Accelerator<br/>Endpoints in AWS Global Accelerator can be Network Load Balancers, Application Load Balancers, Amazon EC2 instances, or Elastic IP addresses. A static IP address serves as a single point of contact for clients, and Global Accelerator then distributes incoming traffic across healthy endpoints. Global Accelerator directs traffic to endpoints by using the port (or port range) that you specify for the listener that the endpoint group for the endpoint belongs to.<br/>Each endpoint group can have multiple endpoints.

The application has a local cache that must be cleared when a deployment occurs.

When you provision a Multi-AZ DB Instance, Amazon RDS automatically creates a primary DB Instance and synchronously replicates the data to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone (AZ). Each AZ runs on its own physically distinct, independent infrastructure, and is engineered to be highly reliable. In case of an infrastructure failure (for example, instance hardware failure, storage failure, or network disruption), Amazon RDS performs an automatic failover to the standby, so that you can resume database operations as soon as the failover is complete.

When you provision a Multi-AZ DB Instance, Amazon RDS automatically creates a primary DB Instance and synchronously replicates the data to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone (AZ). Each AZ runs on its own physically distinct, independent infrastructure, and is engineered to be highly reliable. In case of an infrastructure failure (for example, instance hardware failure, storage failure, or network disruption), Amazon RDS performs an automatic failover to the standby, so that you can resume database operations as soon as the failover is complete. Since the endpoint for your DB Instance remains the same after a failover, your application can resume database operation without the need for manual administrative intervention.Benefits -Enhanced Durability -Multi-AZ deployments for the -,Oracle -, andPostgreSQL -engines utilize synchronous physical replication to keep data on the standby up-to-date with the primary. Multi-AZ deployments for theSQL Server -engine use synchronous logical replication to achieve the same result, employing SQL Server-native Mirroring technology. Both approaches safeguard your data in the event of a DB Instance failure or loss of an Availability Zone.If a storage volume on your primary fails in a Multi-AZ deployment, Amazon RDS automatically initiates a failover to the up-to-date standby. Compare this to aSingle-AZ deployment: in case of a Single-AZ database failure, a user-initiated point-in-time-restore operation will be required. This operation can take several hours to complete, and any data updates that occurred after the latest restorable time (typically within the last five minutes) will not be available.Amazon Aurora -employs a highly durable, SSD-backed virtualized storage layer purpose-built for database workloads. Amazon Aurora automatically replicates your volume six ways, across three Availability Zones. Amazon Aurora storage is fault-tolerant, transparently handling the loss of up to two copies of data without affecting database write availability and up to three copies without affecting read availability. Amazon Aurora storage is also self-healing. Data blocks and disks are continuously scanned for errors and replaced automatically.Increased Availability -You also benefit from enhanced database availability when running Multi-AZ deployments. If an Availability Zone failure or DB Instance failure occurs, your availability impact is limited to the time automatic failover takes to complete: typically under one minute for Amazon Aurora and one to two minutes for other database engines (see theRDS FAQ -for details).The availability benefits of Multi-AZ deployments also extend to planned maintenance and backups. In the case of system upgrades like OS patching or DBInstance scaling, these operations are applied first on the standby, prior to the automatic failover. As a result, your availability impact is, again, only the time required for automatic failover to complete.Unlike Single-AZ deployments, I/O activity is not suspended on your primary during backup for Multi-AZ deployments for the MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL engines, because the backup is taken from the standby. However, note that you may still experience elevated latencies for a few minutes during backups for Multi-AZ deployments.On instance failure in Amazon Aurora deployments, Amazon RDS uses RDS Multi-AZ technology to automate failover to one of up to 15 Amazon Aurora Replicas you have created in any of three Availability Zones. If no Amazon Aurora Replicas have been provisioned, in the case of a failure, Amazon RDS will attempt to create a new Amazon Aurora DB instance for you automatically.No Administrative Intervention -DB Instance failover is fully automatic and requires no administrative intervention. Amazon RDS monitors the health of your primary and standbys, and initiates a failover automatically in response to a variety of failure conditions.Failover conditions -Amazon RDS detects and automatically recovers from the most common failure scenarios for Multi-AZ deployments so that you can resume database operations as quickly as possible without administrative intervention.

S3 Intelligent-Tiering is the first cloud object storage class that delivers automatic cost savings by moving data between two access tiers ג€\" frequent access and infrequent access ג€\" when access patterns change, and is ideal for data with unknown or changing access patterns.S3 Intelligent-Tiering stores objects in two access tiers: one tier that is optimized for frequent access and another lower-cost tier that is optimized for infrequent access. For a small monthly monitoring and automation fee per object, S3 Intelligent-Tiering monitors access patterns and moves objects that have not been accessed for 30 consecutive days to the infrequent access tier. There are no retrieval fees in S3 Intelligent-Tiering. If an object in the infrequent access tier is accessed later, it is automatically moved back to the frequent access tier. No additional tiering fees apply when objects are moved between access tiers within theS3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class.
