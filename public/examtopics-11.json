S3 Versioning protects you from the consequences of unintended overwrites and deletions. You can also use it to archive objects so that you have access to previous versions.<br/>To customize your data retention approach and control storage costs, use object versioning with Object lifecycle management. For information about creating S3<br/>Lifecycle policies using the AWS Management Console, see How Do I Create a Lifecycle Policy for an S3 Bucket? in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Console<br/>User Guide.<br/>If you have an object expiration lifecycle policy in your non-versioned bucket and you want to maintain the same permanent delete behavior when you enable versioning, you must add a noncurrent expiration policy. The noncurrent expiration lifecycle policy will manage the deletes of the noncurrent object versions in the version-enabled bucket. (A version-enabled bucket maintains one current and zero or more noncurrent object versions.)<br/>You must explicitly enable S3 Versioning on your bucket. By default, S3 Versioning is disabled. Regardless of whether you have enabled Versioning, each object in your bucket has a version ID. If you have not enabled Versioning, Amazon S3 sets the value of the version ID to null. If S3 Versioning is enabled, Amazon S3 assigns a version ID value for the object. This value distinguishes it from other versions of the same key.<br/>Enabling and suspending versioning is done at the bucket level. When you enable versioning on an existing bucket, objects that are already stored in the bucket are unchanged. The version IDs (null), contents, and permissions remain the same. After you enable S3 Versioning for a bucket, each object that is added to the bucket gets a version ID, which distinguishes it from other versions of the same key.<br/>Only Amazon S3 generates version IDs, and they canג€™t be edited. Version IDs are Unicode, UTF-8 encoded, URL-ready, opaque strings that are no more than<br/>1,024 bytes long. The following is an example: 3/L4kqtJlcpXroDTDmJ+rmSpXd3dIbrHY+MTRCxf3vjVBH40Nr8X8gdRQBpUMLUo.<br/><br/>Using MFA delete -<br/>If a bucket's versioning configuration is MFA Deleteג€\"enabled, the bucket owner must include the x-amz-mfa request header in requests to permanently delete an object version or change the versioning state of the bucket. Requests that include x-amz-mfa must use HTTPS. The header's value is the concatenation of your authentication device's serial number, a space, and the authentication code displayed on it. If you do not include this request header, the request fails.<br/>Reference:<br/>https://aws.amazon.com/s3/features/<br/>https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ObjectVersioning.html https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingMFADelete.html\n                                    </span>\n</p>\n</div>\n<!-- / Question  -->\n<div class=\"discussion-meta-data mt-3 pt-1 border-top\">\n                                    by\n                                    \n                                    <a class=\"title-username\" href=\"/user/frizzo/\" style=\"\">\n<i class=\"fa fa-user-o\"></i>\n                                        frizzo\n                                    </a>\n                                    \n                                    at <i>\n                                    June 3, 2020, 1:14 a.m.</i>\n</div>\n</div>", "que": ["A solutions architect is implementing a document review application using an Amazon S3 bucket for storage.

If S3 Versioning is enabled, Amazon S3 assigns a version ID value for the object. This value distinguishes it from other versions of the same key.Enabling and suspending versioning is done at the bucket level. When you enable versioning on an existing bucket, objects that are already stored in the bucket are unchanged. The version IDs (null), contents, and permissions remain the same. After you enable S3 Versioning for a bucket, each object that is added to the bucket gets a version ID, which distinguishes it from other versions of the same key.Only Amazon S3 generates version IDs, and they canג€™t be edited. Version IDs are Unicode, UTF-8 encoded, URL-ready, opaque strings that are no more than1,024 bytes long.

S3 Versioning protects you from the consequences of unintended overwrites and deletions. You can also use it to archive objects so that you have access to previous versions.To customize your data retention approach and control storage costs, use object versioning with Object lifecycle management. For information about creating S3Lifecycle policies using the AWS Management Console, see How Do I Create a Lifecycle Policy for an S3 Bucket? in the Amazon Simple Storage Service ConsoleUser Guide.If you have an object expiration lifecycle policy in your non-versioned bucket and you want to maintain the same permanent delete behavior when you enable versioning, you must add a noncurrent expiration policy.

The same data is available in all supported AWS Regions using an AmazonDynamoDB global table.What change should be made to avoid causing disruptions in device operations?", "Suggested Answer:\nA"], "que_header": "<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 569<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>", "ans": "Suggested Answer:\nA ", "ans_details": "\n"}, {"name": "Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional topic 1 question 568 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/28167-exam-aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional-topic-1/", "reply": "31", "views": "2626", "username": "Nemer", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            Waiweng\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 1Â month, 3Â weeks ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 568<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"675271\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">An advisory firm is creating a secure data analytics solution for its regulated financial services users.

You can use this to delay the time for starting a process.Configuration -Benefits -You can increase or decrease the number of servers for processing jobs to change automatically the processing speeds of the priority queues and secondary queues.You can handle performance and service requirements through merely increasing or decreasing the number of EC2 instances used in job processing.Even if an EC2 were to fail, the messages (jobs) would remain in the queue service, enabling processing to be continued immediately upon recovery of the EC2 instance, producing a system that is robust to failure.Cautions -Depending on the balance between the number of EC2 instances for performing the processes and the number of messages that are queued, there may be cases where processing in the secondary queue may be completed first, so you need to monitor the processing speeds in the primary queue and the secondary queue.\n                                    "}, {"name": "Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional topic 1 question 550 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/17372-exam-aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional-topic-1/", "reply": "25", "views": "2193", "username": "Asds", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            Waiweng\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 1Â month, 4Â weeks ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 550<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"675253\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">A company wants to launch an online shopping website in multiple countries and must ensure that customers are protected against potential ג€man-in-the-middleג€ attacks.<br/>Which architecture will provide the MOST secure site access?<br/></p>\n<div class=\"question-choices-container\">\n<ul>\n<li class=\"multi-choice-item\">\n<span class=\"multi-choice-letter\">\n                                                        A.\n                                                    </span>\n                                                    \n                                                    Use Amazon Route 53 for domain registration and DNS services.

However, we strongly recommend that you do not embed or distribute long-term AWS credentials with apps that a user downloads to a device, even in an encrypted store. Instead, build your app so that it requests temporary AWS security credentials dynamically when needed using web identity federation. The supplied temporary credentials map to an AWS role that has only the permissions needed to perform the tasks required by the mobile app.<br/>With web identity federation, you don't need to create custom sign-in code or manage your own user identities. Instead, users of your app can sign in using a well- known identity provider (IdP) ג€\"such as Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google, or any other<br/>OpenID Connect (OIDC)<br/>-compatible IdP, receive an authentication<br/>token, and then exchange that token for temporary security credentials in AWS that map to an IAM role with permissions to use the resources in your AWS account. Using an IdP helps you keep your AWS account secure, because you don't have to embed and distribute long-term security credentials with your application.<br/>For most scenarios, we recommend that you use<br/><br/>Amazon Cognito -<br/>because it acts as an identity broker and does much of the federation work for you. For details, see the following section,<br/>Using Amazon Cognito for Mobile Apps<br/>.<br/>If you don't use Amazon Cognito, then you must write code that interacts with a web IdP (Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google, or any other OIDC-compatible<br/>IdP) and then calls the AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity API to trade the authentication token you get from those IdPs for AWS temporary security credentials. If you have already used this approach for existing apps, you can continue to use it.<br/>Using Amazon Cognito for Mobile Apps<br/>The preferred way to use web identity federation is to use<br/><br/>Amazon Cognito -<br/>. For example, Adele the developer is building a game for a mobile device where user data such as scores and profiles is stored in Amazon S3 and Amazon DynamoDB. Adele could also store this data locally on the device and use Amazon Cognito to keep it synchronized across devices. She knows that for security and maintenance reasons, long-term AWS security credentials should not be distributed with the game. She also knows that the game might have a large number of users. For all of these reasons, she does not want to create new user identities in IAM for each player. Instead, she builds the game so that users can sign in using an identity that they've already established with a well-known identity provider, such as<br/>Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google, or any OpenID Connect (OIDC)-compatible identity provider. Her game can take advantage of the authentication mechanism from one of these providers to validate the user's identity.<br/>To enable the mobile app to access her AWS resources, Adele first registers for a developer ID with her chosen IdPs. She also configures the application with each of these providers. In her AWS account that contains the Amazon S3 bucket and DynamoDB table for the game, Adele uses Amazon Cognito to create IAM roles that precisely define permissions that the game needs. If she is using an OIDC IdP, she also creates an IAM OIDC identity provider entity to establish trust between her AWS account and the IdP.<br/>In the app's code, Adele calls the sign-in interface for the IdP that she configured previously. The IdP handles all the details of letting the user sign in, and the app gets an OAuth access token or OIDC ID token from the provider. Adele's app can trade this authentication information for a set of temporary security credentials that consist of an AWS access key ID, a secret access key, and a session token. The app can then use these credentials to access web services offered by AWS.<br/>The app is limited to the permissions that are defined in the role that it assumes.<br/>The following figure shows a simplified flow for how this might work, using Login with Amazon as the IdP.

When you set up an identity pool, Amazon Cognito creates one or two IAM roles (one for authenticated identities, and one for unauthenticated \"guest\" identities) that define permissions for Amazon Cognito users.Download and integrate the -AWS SDK for iOS -or theAWS SDK for Android -with your app, and import the files required to use Amazon Cognito.Create an instance of the Amazon Cognito credentials provider, passing the identity pool ID, your AWS account number, and the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the roles that you associated with the identity pool.

However, we strongly recommend that you do not embed or distribute long-term AWS credentials with apps that a user downloads to a device, even in an encrypted store. Instead, build your app so that it requests temporary AWS security credentials dynamically when needed using web identity federation. The supplied temporary credentials map to an AWS role that has only the permissions needed to perform the tasks required by the mobile app.With web identity federation, you don't need to create custom sign-in code or manage your own user identities. Instead, users of your app can sign in using a well- known identity provider (IdP) ג€\"such as Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google, or any otherOpenID Connect (OIDC)-compatible IdP, receive an authenticationtoken, and then exchange that token for temporary security credentials in AWS that map to an IAM role with permissions to use the resources in your AWS account. Using an IdP helps you keep your AWS account secure, because you don't have to embed and distribute long-term security credentials with your application.For most scenarios, we recommend that you useAmazon Cognito -because it acts as an identity broker and does much of the federation work for you. For details, see the following section,Using Amazon Cognito for Mobile Apps.If you don't use Amazon Cognito, then you must write code that interacts with a web IdP (Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google, or any other OIDC-compatibleIdP) and then calls the AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity API to trade the authentication token you get from those IdPs for AWS temporary security credentials. If you have already used this approach for existing apps, you can continue to use it.Using Amazon Cognito for Mobile AppsThe preferred way to use web identity federation is to useAmazon Cognito -. For example, Adele the developer is building a game for a mobile device where user data such as scores and profiles is stored in Amazon S3 and Amazon DynamoDB. Adele could also store this data locally on the device and use Amazon Cognito to keep it synchronized across devices. She knows that for security and maintenance reasons, long-term AWS security credentials should not be distributed with the game. She also knows that the game might have a large number of users. For all of these reasons, she does not want to create new user identities in IAM for each player. Instead, she builds the game so that users can sign in using an identity that they've already established with a well-known identity provider, such asLogin with Amazon, Facebook, Google, or any OpenID Connect (OIDC)-compatible identity provider. Her game can take advantage of the authentication mechanism from one of these providers to validate the user's identity.To enable the mobile app to access her AWS resources, Adele first registers for a developer ID with her chosen IdPs. She also configures the application with each of these providers. In her AWS account that contains the Amazon S3 bucket and DynamoDB table for the game, Adele uses Amazon Cognito to create IAM roles that precisely define permissions that the game needs. If she is using an OIDC IdP, she also creates an IAM OIDC identity provider entity to establish trust between her AWS account and the IdP.In the app's code, Adele calls the sign-in interface for the IdP that she configured previously. The IdP handles all the details of letting the user sign in, and the app gets an OAuth access token or OIDC ID token from the provider. Adele's app can trade this authentication information for a set of temporary security credentials that consist of an AWS access key ID, a secret access key, and a session token. The app can then use these credentials to access web services offered by AWS.The app is limited to the permissions that are defined in the role that it assumes.The following figure shows a simplified flow for how this might work, using Login with Amazon as the IdP. For Step 2, the app can also use Facebook, Google, or any OIDC-compatible identity provider, but that's not shown here.Sample workflow using Amazon Cognito to federate users for a mobile applicationA customer starts your app on a mobile device. The app asks the user to sign in.The app uses Login with Amazon resources to accept the user's credentials.The app uses Cognito APIs to exchange the Login with Amazon ID token for a Cognito token.The app requests temporary security credentials from AWS STS, passing the Cognito token.The temporary security credentials can be used by the app to access any AWS resources required by the app to operate. The role associated with the temporary security credentials and its assigned policies determines what can be accessed.Use the following process to configure your app to use Amazon Cognito to authenticate users and give your app access to AWS resources. For specific steps to accomplish this scenario, consult the documentation for Amazon Cognito.(Optional) Sign up as a developer with Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google, or any other OpenID Connect (OIDC)ג€\"compatible identity provider and configure one or more apps with the provider.

Currently, log files are delivered daily to AmazonLinux on an Amazon EC2 instance. A batch script is run once a day to aggregate data used for analysis by a third-party tool. The data pushed to the third-party tool is used to generate a visualization for end users. The batch script is cumbersome to maintain, and it takes several hours to deliver the ever-increasing data volumes to the third-party tool.

You deploy a single EC2 instance running proxy software and configure It to accept traffic from all subnets and EC2 instances in the VPC. You configure the proxy to only pass through traffic to domains that you define in its whitelist configuration. You have a nightly maintenance window or 10 minutes where all instances fetch new software updates. Each update Is about 200MB In size and there are 500 instances In the VPC that routinely fetch updates. After a few days you notice that some machines are failing to successfully download some, but not all of their updates within the maintenance window.
