      "<p class=\"collapse exam_answer\" id=\"exam_question_1\" style=\"clear: both;\"><strong>Answer: </strong>C<br/> <br/>Explanation:<br/> <br/>Using Reduced Redundancy Storage<br/> <br/>Amazon 53 stores objects according to their storage class. It assigns the storage class to an object when it is written to Amazon 53. You can assign objects a specific sto rage class (standard or reduced redundancy) only when you write the objects to an Amazon 53 bucket or when you copy objects that are already stored in Amazon 53. Standard is the default storage class. For information about storage classes, see Object Key and Metadata.<br/> <br/>In order to reduce storage costs, you can use reduced redundancy storage for noncritical, reproducible data at lower levels of redundancy than Amazon 53 provides with standard storage. The lower level of redundancy results in less durability and availability, but in many cases, the lower costs can make reduced redundancy storage an acceptable storage solution. For example, it can be a costeffective solution for sharing media content that is durably stored elsewhere. It can also make sense if you are storing thumbnails and other resized images that can be easily reproduced from an original image.<br/> <br/>Reduced redundancy storage is designed to provide 99.99% durability of objects over a given year.<br/> <br/>This durability level corresponds to an average annual expected loss of 0.01% of objects. For example, if you store 10,000 objects using the RRS option, you can, on average, expect to incur an annual loss of a single object per year (0.01% of 10,000 objects).<br/> <br/>Note<br/> <br/>This annual loss represents an expected average and does not guarantee the loss of less than 0.01% of objects in a given year.<br/> <br/>Reduced redundancy storage stores objects on multiple devices across multiple facilities, providing 400 times the durability of a typical disk drive, but it does not replicate objects as many times as Amazon 53 standard storage. In addition, reduced redundancy storage is designed to sustain the loss of data in a single facility.<br/> <br/>If an object in reduced redundancy storage has been lost, Amazon 53 will return a 405 error on requests made to that object. Amazon 53 also offers notifications for reduced redundancy storage object loss: you can configure your bucket so that when Amazon 53 detects the loss of an RRS object, a notification will be sent through Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS). You can then replace the lost object. To enable notifications, you can use the Amazon 53 console to set the Notifications property of your bucket. </p>",

      "<p class=\"collapse exam_answer\" id=\"exam_question_1\" style=\"clear: both;\"><strong>Answer: </strong>C<br/> <br/>Explanation:<br/> <br/>Using Reduced Redundancy Storage<br/> <br/>Amazon 53 stores objects according to their storage class. It assigns the storage class to an object when it is written to Amazon 53. You can assign objects a specific sto rage class (standard or reduced redundancy) only when you write the objects to an Amazon 53 bucket or when you copy objects that are already stored in Amazon 53. Standard is the default storage class. For information about storage classes, see Object Key and Metadata.<br/> <br/>In order to reduce storage costs, you can use reduced redundancy storage for noncritical, reproducible data at lower levels of redundancy than Amazon 53 provides with standard storage. The lower level of redundancy results in less durability and availability, but in many cases, the lower costs can make reduced redundancy storage an acceptable storage solution. For example, it can be a costeffective solution for sharing media content that is durably stored elsewhere. It can also make sense if you are storing thumbnails and other resized images that can be easily reproduced from an original image.<br/> <br/>Reduced redundancy storage is designed to provide 99.99% durability of objects over a given year.<br/> <br/>This durability level corresponds to an average annual expected loss of 0.01% of objects. For example, if you store 10,000 objects using the RRS option, you can, on average, expect to incur an annual loss of a single object per year (0.01% of 10,000 objects).<br/> <br/>Note<br/> <br/>This annual loss represents an expected average and does not guarantee the loss of less than 0.01% of objects in a given year.<br/> <br/>Reduced redundancy storage stores objects on multiple devices across multiple facilities, providing 400 times the durability of a typical disk drive, but it does not replicate objects as many times as Amazon 53 standard storage. In addition, reduced redundancy storage is designed to sustain the loss of data in a single facility.<br/> <br/>If an object in reduced redundancy storage has been lost, Amazon 53 will return a 405 error on requests made to that object. Amazon 53 also offers notifications for reduced redundancy storage object loss: you can configure your bucket so that when Amazon 53 detects the loss of an RRS object, a notification will be sent through Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS). You can then replace the lost object. To enable notifications, you can use the Amazon 53 console to set the Notifications property of your bucket. </p>",

      "<p class=\"collapse exam_answer\" id=\"exam_question_1\" style=\"clear: both;\"><strong>Answer: </strong>D<br/> <br/>Explanation:<br/> <br/>With DNS Failover, Amazon Route 53 can help detect an outage of your website and redirect your end users to alternate locations where your application is operating properly. When you enable this feature, Route 53 uses health checks―regularly making Internet requests to your application’s endpoints from multiple locations around the world―to determine whether each endpoint of your application is up or down.<br/> <br/>To enable DNS Failover for an ELB endpoint, create an Alias record pointing to the ELB and set the “Evaluate Target Health” parameter to true. Route 53 creates and manages the health checks for your ELB automatically. You do not need to create your own Route 53 health check of the ELB. You also do not need to associate your resource record set for the ELB with your own health check, because Route 53 automatically associates it with the health checks that Route 53 manages on your behalf. The ELB health check will also inherit the health of your backend instances behind that ELB.<br/> <br/>Reference: http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2013/05/30/amazon-route-53-adds-elb-integration-for-dns-failover/</p>",

He then tells you he is being charged $50 a month for the domain, which is registered with the same people that set it up, and he asks if it’s possible to move that to AWS as well. You tell him you aren’t sure, but will look into it.<br/> <br/>Which of the following statements is true in regards to transferring domain names to AWS?<br/>A .  You can’t transfer existing domains to AW<br/>C .  You can transfer existing domains into Amazon Route 53’s management.<br/>D .  You can transfer existing domains via AWS Direct Connect.<br/>E .  You can transfer existing domains via AWS Import/Export.</p>",

      "<p class=\"collapse exam_answer\" id=\"exam_question_1\" style=\"clear: both;\"><strong>Answer: </strong>D<br/> <br/>Explanation:<br/> <br/>Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) is a highly scalable and cost-effective email-sending service for businesses and developers. Amazon SES eliminates the complexity and expense of building an in-house email solution or licensing, installing, and operating a third-party email service for this type of email communication.<br/> <br/>Every Amazon SES sender has a unique set of sending limits, which are calculated by Amazon SES on an ongoing basis:<br/> <br/>Sending quota ― the maximum number of emails you can send in a 24-hour period.<br/> <br/>Maximum send rate ― the maximum number of emails you can send per second.<br/> <br/>New Amazon SES users who have received production access can send up to 10,000 emails per 24-hour period, at a maximum rate of 5 emails per second. Amazon SES automatically adjusts these limits upward, as long as you send high-quality email. If your existing quota is not adequate for your needs and the system has not automatically increased your quota, you can submit an SES Sending Quota Increase case at any time.<br/> <br/>Sending limits are based on recipients rather than on messages. You can check your sending limits at any time by using the Amazon SES console.<br/> <br/>Note that if your email is detected to be of poor or questionable quality (e.g., high complaint rates, high bounce rates, spam, or abusive content), Amazon SES might temporarily or permanently reduce your permitted send volume, or take other action as AWS deems appropriate.<br/> <br/>Reference: https://aws.amazon.com/ses/faqs/</p>",

      "<p class=\"collapse exam_answer\" id=\"exam_question_1\" style=\"clear: both;\"><strong>Answer: </strong>D<br/> <br/>Explanation:<br/> <br/>Several factors can affect the performance of Amazon EBS volumes, such as instance configuration, I/O characteristics, workload demand, and storage configuration.<br/> <br/>IOPS are input/output operations per second. Amazon EBS measures each I/O operation per second (that is 256 KB or smaller) as one IOPS. I/O operations that are larger than 256 KB are counted in 256 KB capacity units.<br/> <br/>For example, a 1,024 KB I/O operation would count as 4 IOPS.<br/> <br/>When you provision a 4,000 IOPS volume and attach it to an EBS-optimized instance that can provide the necessary bandwidth, you can transfer up to 4,000 chunks of data per second (provided that the I/O does not exceed the 128 MB/s per volume throughput limit of General Purpose (SSD) and Provisioned IOPS (SSD) volumes).<br/> <br/>Reference: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSPerformance.html</p>",

      "<p class=\"collapse exam_answer\" id=\"exam_question_1\" style=\"clear: both;\"><strong>Answer: </strong>B, E<br/> <br/>Explanation:<br/> <br/>How Health Checks Work in Complex Amazon Route 53 Configurations<br/> <br/>Checking the health of resources in complex configurations works much the same way as in simple configurations.<br/> <br/>However, in complex configurations, you use a combination of alias resource recordsets (including weighted alias, latency alias, and failover alias) and nonalias resource record sets to build a decision tree that gives you greater control over how Amazon Route 53 responds to requests.<br/> <br/>For more information, see How Health Checks Work in Simple Amazon Route 53 Configurations.<br/> <br/>For example, you might use latency alias resource record sets to select a region close to a user and use weighted resource record sets for two or more resources within each region to protect againstthe failure of a single endpoint or an Availability Zone. The following diagram shows this configuration. </p>",
      "<p><img height=\"363\" src=\"https://www.exam4training.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image015.jpg\" v:shapes=\"_x0000_i1031\" width=\"604\"/></p>",
      "<p>Here’s how Amazon EC2 and Amazon Route 53 are configured:<br/> <br/>You have Amazon EC2 instances in two regions, us-east-1 and ap-southeast-2. You want Amazon Route 53 to respond to queries by using the resource record sets in the region that provides the lowest latency for your customers, so you create a latency alias resource record set for each region.<br/> <br/>(You create the latency alias resource record sets after you create resource record sets for the individual Amazon EC2 instances.)<br/> <br/>Within each region, you have two Amazon EC2 instances. You create a weighted resource record set for each instance. The name and the type are the same for both of the weighted resource record sets in each region.<br/> <br/>When you have multiple resources in a region, you can create weighted or failover resource record sets for your resources. You can also create even more complex configurations by creating weighted alias or failover alias resource record sets that, in turn, refer to multiple resources.<br/> <br/>Each weighted resource record set has an associated health check. The IP address for each health check matches the I P address for the corresponding resource record set. This isn’t required, but it’s the most common configuration.<br/> <br/>For both latency alias resource record sets, you set the value of Evaluate Target Health to Yes.<br/> <br/>You use the Evaluate Target Health setting for each latency alias resource record set to make Amazon Route 53 evaluate the health of the alias targets-the weighted resource record sets-and respond accordingly. </p>",
      "<p><img height=\"458\" src=\"https://www.exam4training.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image017.jpg\" v:shapes=\"_x0000_i1032\" width=\"605\"/></p>",
      "<p>The preceding diagram illustrates the following sequence of events:<br/> <br/>Amazon Route 53 receives a query for example.com. Based on the latency for the user making the request, Amazon Route 53 selects the latency alias resource record set for the us-east-1 region.<br/> <br/>Amazon Route 53 selects a weighted resource record set based on weight. Evaluate Target Health is Yes for the latency alias resource record set, so Amazon Route 53 checks the health of the selected weighted resource record set.<br/> <br/>The health check failed, so Amazon Route 53 chooses another weighted resource record set based on weight and checks its health. That resource record set also is unhealthy.<br/> <br/>Amazon Route 53 backs out of that branch of the tree, looks for the latency alias resource record set with the next-best latency, and chooses the resource record set for ap-southeast-2.<br/> <br/>Amazon Route 53 again selects a resource record set based on weight, and then checks the health of the selected resource record set. The health check passed, so Amazon Route 53 returns the applicable value in response to the query.<br/> <br/>What Happens When You Associate a Health Check with an Alias Resource Record Set?<br/> <br/>You can associate a health check with an alias resource record set instead of or in addition to setting the value of Evaluate Target Health to Yes.<br/> <br/>However, it’s generally more useful if Amazon Route 53responds to queries based on the health of the underlying resources- the HTTP servers, database servers, and other resources that your alias resource record sets refer to. For example, suppose the following configuration:<br/> <br/>You assign a health check to a latency alias resource record set for which the alias target is a group of weighted resource record sets.<br/> <br/>You set the value of Evaluate Target Health to Yes for the latency alias resource record set.<br/> <br/>In this configuration, both of the following must be true before Amazon Route 53 will return the applicable value for a weighted resource record set:<br/> <br/>The health check associated with the latency alias resource record set must pass.<br/> <br/>At least one weighted resource record set must be considered healthy, either because it’s associated with a health check that passes or because it’s not associated with a health check. In the latter case, Amazon Route 53 always considers the weighted resource record set healthy. </p>",

      "<p>If the health check for the latency alias resource record set fails, Amazon Route 53 stops responding to queries using any of the weighted resource record sets in the alias target, even if they’re all healthy. Amazon Route 53 doesn’t know the status of the weighted resource record sets because it never looks past the failed health check on the alias resource record set.<br/> <br/>What Happens When You Omit Health Checks?<br/> <br/>In a complex configuration, it’s important to associate health checks with all of the non-alias resource record sets. Let’s return to the preceding example, but assume that a health check is missing on one of the weighted resource record sets in the us-east-1 region: </p>",

      "<p>Here’s what happens when you omit a health check on a non-alias resource record set in this configuration:<br/> <br/>Amazon Route 53 receives a query for example.com. Based on the latency for the user making the request, Amazon Route 53 selects the latency alias resource record set for the us-east-1 region.<br/> <br/>Amazon Route 53 looks up the alias target for the latency alias resource record set, and checks the status of the corresponding health checks. The health check for one weighted resource record set failed, so that resource record set is omitted from consideration.<br/> <br/>The other weighted resource record set in the alias target for the us-east-1 region has no health check. The corresponding resource might or might not be healthy, but without a health check, Amazon Route 53 has no way to know. Amazon Route 53 assumes that the resource is healthy and returns the applicable value in response to the query.<br/> <br/>What Happens When You Set Evaluate Target Health to No?<br/> <br/>In general, you also want to set Evaluate Target Health to Yes for all of the alias resource record sets.<br/> <br/>In the following example, all of the weighted resource record sets have associated health checks, but Evaluate Target Health is set to No for the latency alias resource record set for the us-east-1 region: </p>",

They’re both failing.<br/> <br/>Because the value of Evaluate Target Health is No for the latency alias resource record set for the us-east-1 region, Amazon Route 53 must choose one resource record set in this branch instead of backing out of the branch and looking for a healthy resource record set in the ap-southeast-2 region.</p>",

      "<p class=\"collapse exam_answer\" id=\"exam_question_1\" style=\"clear: both;\"><strong>Answer: </strong>A<br/> <br/>Explanation:<br/> <br/>If you have multiple VPN connections, you can provide secure communication between sites using the AWS VPN CloudHub. The VPN CloudHub operates on a simple hub-and-spoke model that you can use with or without a VPC. This design is suitable for customers with multiple branch offices and existing Internet connections who’d like to implement a convenient, potentially low-cost hub-and-spoke model for primary or backup connectivity between these remote offices.<br/> <br/>To use the AWS VPN CloudHub, you must create a virtual private gateway with multiple customer gateways, each with unique Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs).Customer gateways advertise the appropriate routes (BGP prefixes) over their VPN connections. These routing advertisements are received and re-advertised to each BGP peer, enabling each site to send data to and receive data from the other sites. The routes for each spoke must have unique ASNs and the sites must not have overlapping IP ranges. Each site can also send and receive data from the VPC as if they were using a standard VPN connection.<br/> <br/>Reference: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPN_CloudHub.html</p>",

      "<p class=\"collapse exam_answer\" id=\"exam_question_1\" style=\"clear: both;\"><strong>Answer: </strong>D<br/> <br/>Explanation:<br/> <br/>Amazon ElastiCache is a web service that makes it easy to deploy and run Memcached or Redis protocol-compliant server nodes in the cloud. Amazon ElastiCache improves the performance of web applications by allowing you to retrieve information from a fast, managed, in-memory caching system, instead of relying entirely on slower disk-based databases. The service simplifies and offloads the management, monitoring and operation of in-memory cache environments, enabling your engineering resources to focus on developing applications.<br/> <br/>Using Amazon ElastiCache, you can not only improve load and response times to user actions and queries, but also reduce the cost associated with scaling web applications.<br/> <br/>Reference: https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/faqs/</p>",

      "<p class=\"collapse exam_answer\" id=\"exam_question_1\" style=\"clear: both;\"><strong>Answer: </strong>D<br/> <br/>Explanation:<br/> <br/>BitTorrent is an open, peer-to-peer protocol for distributing files. You can use the BitTorrent protocol to retrieve any publicly-accessible object in Amazon S3.<br/> <br/>Amazon S3 supports the BitTorrent protocol so that developers can save costs when distributing content at high scale. Amazon S3 is useful for simple, reliable storage of any data. The default distribution mechanism for Amazon S3 data is via client/server download. In client/server distribution, the entire object is transferred point-to-point from Amazon S3 to every authorized user who requests that object. While client/server delivery is appropriate for a wide variety of use cases, it is not optimal for everybody. Specifically, the costs of client/server distribution increase linearly as the number of users downloading objects increases. This can make it expensive to distribute popular objects.<br/> <br/>BitTorrent addresses this problem by recruiting the very clients that are downloading the object as distributors themselves: Each client downloads some pieces of the object from Amazon S3 and some from other clients, while simultaneously uploading pieces of the same object to other interested \"peers.\" The benefit for publishers is that for large, popular files the amount of data actually supplied by Amazon S3 can be substantially lower than what it would have been serving the same clients via client/server download. Less data transferred means lower costs for the publisher of the object.<br/> <br/>Reference: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3Torrent.html</p>",

      "<p class=\"collapse exam_answer\" id=\"exam_question_1\" style=\"clear: both;\"><strong>Answer: </strong>B<br/> <br/>Explanation:<br/> <br/>Auto Scaling enables you to follow the demand curve for your applications closely, reducing the need to manually provision Amazon EC2 capacity in advance. For example, you can set a condition to add new Amazon EC2 instances in increments to the Auto Scaling group when the average utilization of your Amazon EC2 fleet is high; and similarly, you can set a condition to remove instances in the same increments when CPU utilization is low. If you have predictable load changes, you can set a schedule through Auto Scaling to plan your scaling activities. You can use Amazon CloudWatch to send alarms to trigger scaling activities and Elastic Load Balancing to help distribute traffic to your instances within Auto Scaling groups. Auto Scaling enables you to run your Amazon EC2 fleet at optimal utilization.<br/> <br/>Reference: http://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/</p>",

Amazon EC2 is designed to make web-scale computing easier by enabling you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction.<br/> <br/>You create and launch instances, which are collections of platform hardware and software.<br/> <br/>Different instances running on the same physical machine are isolated from each other via the Xen hypervisor.<br/> <br/>Amazon is active in the Xen community, which provides awareness of the latest developments. In addition, the AWS firewall resides within the hypervisor layer, between the physical network interface and the instance’s virtual interface. All packets must pass through this layer, thus an instance’s neighbors have no more access to that instance than any other host on the Internet and can be treated as if they are on separate physical hosts. The physical RAM is separated using similar mechanisms.<br/> <br/>Reference: http://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/Security/AWS%20Security%20Whitepaper.pdf</p>",

      "<p class=\"collapse exam_answer\" id=\"exam_question_1\" style=\"clear: both;\"><strong>Answer: </strong>D<br/> <br/>Explanation:<br/> <br/>Amazon RDS Multi-AZ Deployments<br/> <br/>Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployments provide enhanced availability and durability for Database (DB) Instances, making them a natural fit for production database workloads. When you provision a Multi-AZ DB Instance, Amazon RDS automatically creates a primary DB Instance and synchronously replicates the data to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone (AZ). Each AZ runs on its own physically distinct, independent infrastructure, and is engineered to be highly reliable. In case of an infrastructure failure (for example, instance hardware failure, storage failure, or network disruption), Amazon RDS performs an automatic failover to the standby, so that you can resume database operations as soon as the failover is complete. Since the endpoint for your DB Instance remains the same after a failover, your application can resume database operation without the need for manual administrative intervention.<br/> <br/>Enhanced Durability<br/> <br/>Multi-AZ deployments for the MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL engines utilize synchronous physical replication to keep data on the standby up-to-date with the primary. Multi-AZ deployments for the SQL Server engine use synchronous logical replication to achieve the same result, employing SQL Server-native Mirroring technology. Both approaches safeguard your data in the event of a DB Instance failure or loss of an Availability Zone.<br/> <br/>If a storage volume on your primary fails in a Multi-AZ deployment, Amazon RDS automatically initiates a failover to the up-to-date standby. Compare this to a Single-AZ deployment: in case of a Single-AZ database failure, a user-initiated point-in-time-restore operation will be required. This operation can take several hours to complete, and any data updates that occurred after the latest restorable time (typically within the last five minutes) will not be available.<br/> <br/>Amazon Aurora employs a highly durable, SSD-backed virtualized storage layer purpose-built for database workloads. Amazon Aurora automatically replicates your volume six ways, across three<br/> <br/>Availability Zones. Amazon Aurora storage is fault-tolerant, transparently handling the loss of up to two copies of data without affecting database write availability and up to three copies without affecting read availability. Amazon Aurora storage is also self-healing. Data blocks and disks are continuously scanned for errors and replaced automatically.<br/> <br/>Increased Availability<br/> <br/>You also benefit from enhanced database availability when running Multi-AZ deployments. If an Availability Zone failure or DB Instance failure occurs, your availability impact is limited to the time automatic failover takes to complete: typically under one minute for Amazon Aurora and one to two minutes for other database engines (see the RDS FAQ for details).<br/> <br/>The availability benefits of Multi-AZ deployments also extend to planned maintenance and backups. In the case of system upgrades like OS patching or DB Instance scaling, these operations are applied first on the standby, prior to the automatic failover. As a result, your availability impact is, again, only the time required for automatic failover to complete.<br/> <br/>Unlike Single-AZ deployments, 1/0 activity is not suspended on your primary during backup for Multi-AZ deployments for the MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL engines, because the backup is taken from the standby.<br/> <br/>However, note that you may still experience elevated latencies for a few minutes during backups for Multi-AZ deployments.<br/> <br/>On instance failure in Amazon Aurora deployments, Amazon RDS uses RDS Multi-AZ technology to automate failover to one of up to 15 Amazon Aurora Replicas you have created in any of three Availability Zones. If no Amazon Aurora Replicas have been provisioned, in the case of a failure, Amazon RDS will attempt to create a new Amazon Aurora DB instance for you automatically.</p>",

      "<p class=\"collapse exam_answer\" id=\"exam_question_1\" style=\"clear: both;\"><strong>Answer: </strong>C<br/> <br/>Explanation:<br/> <br/>Granting Cross-account Permission to objects It Does Not Own<br/> <br/>In this example scenario, you own a bucket and you have enabled other AWS accounts to upload objects. That is, your bucket can have objects that other AWS accounts own.<br/> <br/>Now, suppose as a bucket owner, you need to grant cross-account permission on objects, regardless of who the owner is, to a user in another account. For example, that user could be a billing application that needs to access object metadata. There are two core issues:<br/> <br/>The bucket owner has no permissions on those objects created by other AWS accounts. So for the bucket owner to grant permissions on objects it does not own, the object owner, the AWS accountthat created the objects, must first grant permission to the bucket owner. The bucket owner can then delegate those permissions.<br/> <br/>Bucket owner account can delegate permissions to users in its own account but it cannot delegate permissions to other AWS accounts, because cross-account delegation is not supported.<br/> <br/>In this scenario, the bucket owner can create an AWS Identity and Access Management (lAM) role with permission to access objects, and grant another AWS account permission to assume the role temporarily enabling it to access objects in the bucket.<br/> <br/>Background: Cross-Account Permissions and Using lAM Roles<br/> <br/>lAM roles enable several scenarios to delegate access to your resources, and cross-account access is one of the key scenarios. In this example, the bucket owner, Account A, uses an lAM role to temporarily delegate object access cross-account to users in another AWS account, Account C. Each lAM role you create has two policies attached to it:<br/> <br/>A trust policy identifying another AWS account that can assume the role.<br/> <br/>An access policy defining what permissions-for example, s3:Get0bject-are allowed when someone assumes the role. For a list of permissions you can specify in a policy, see Specifying Permissions in a Policy.<br/> <br/>The AWS account identified in the trust policy then grants its user permission to assume the role. The user can then do the following to access objects:<br/> <br/>Assume the role and, in response, get temporary security credentials.<br/> <br/>Using the temporary security credentials, access the objects in the bucket.<br/> <br/>For more information about lAM roles, go to Roles (Delegation and Federation) in lAM User Guide.<br/> <br/>The following is a summary of the walkthrough steps: </p>",
      "<p><img height=\"282\" src=\"https://www.exam4training.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image031.jpg\" v:shapes=\"_x0000_i1039\" width=\"487\"/></p>",
      "<p>Account A administrator user attaches a bucket policy granting Account B conditional permission to upload objects.<br/> <br/>Account A administrator creates an lAM role, establishing trust with Account C, so users in that account can access Account A. The access policy attached to the ro le limits what user in Account C can do when the user accesses Account A.<br/> <br/>Account B administrator uploads an object to the bucket owned by Account A, granting full Ccontrol permission to the bucket owner.<br/> <br/>Account C administrator creates a user and attaches a user policy that allows the user to assume the role.<br/> <br/>User in Account C first assumes the role, which returns the user temporary security credentials.<br/> <br/>Using those temporary credentials, the user then accesses objects in the bucket.<br/> <br/>For this example, you need three accounts. The following table shows how we refer to these accounts and the administrator users in these accounts. Per lAM guidelines (see About Using an<br/> <br/>Administrator User to Create Resources and Grant Permissions) we do not use the account root credentials in this walkthrough. Instead, you create an administrator user in each account and usethose credentials in creating resources and granting them permissions </p>",

      "<p class=\"collapse exam_answer\" id=\"exam_question_1\" style=\"clear: both;\"><strong>Answer: </strong>C<br/> <br/>Explanation:<br/> <br/>Bucket Owner Granting Cross-account Permission to objects It Does Not Own<br/> <br/>In this example scenario, you own a bucket and you have enabled other AWS accounts to upload objects. That is, your bucket can have objects that other AWS accounts own.<br/> <br/>Now, suppose as a bucket owner, you need to grant cross-account permission on objects, regardless of who the owner is, to a user in another account. For example, that user could be a billing application that needs to access object metadata. There are two core issues:<br/> <br/>The bucket owner has no permissions on those objects created by other AWS accounts. So for the bucket owner to grant permissions on objects it does not own, the object owner, the AWS account that created the objects, must first grant permission to the bucket owner. The bucket owner can then delegate those permissions.<br/> <br/>Bucket owner account can delegate permissions to users in its own account but it cannot delegate permissions to other AWS accounts, because cross-account delegation is not supported.<br/> <br/>In this scenario, the bucket owner can create an AWS Identity and Access Management (lAM) role with permission to access objects, and grant another AWS account permission to assume the role temporarily enabling it to access objects in the bucket.<br/> <br/>Background: Cross-Account Permissions and Using lAM Roles<br/> <br/>lAM roles enable several scenarios to delegate access to your resources, and cross-account access is one of the key scenarios. In this example, the bucket owner, Account A, uses an lAM role to temporarily delegate object access cross-account to users in another AWS account, Account C. Each lAM role you create has two policies attached to it:<br/> <br/>A trust policy identifying another AWS account that can assume the role.<br/> <br/>An access policy defining what permissions-for example, s3:Get0bject-are allowed when someone assumes the role. For a list of permissions you can specify in a policy, see Specifying Permissions in aPolicy.<br/> <br/>The AWS account identified in the trust policy then grants its user permission to assume the role. The user can then do the following to access objects:<br/> <br/>Assume the role and, in response, get temporary security credentials.<br/> <br/>Using the temporary security credentials, access the objects in the bucket.<br/> <br/>For more information about lAM roles, go to Roles (Delegation and Federation) in lAM User Guide.<br/> <br/>The following is a summary of the walkthrough steps: </p>",
      "<p><img height=\"282\" src=\"https://www.exam4training.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image031-1.jpg\" v:shapes=\"_x0000_i1041\" width=\"487\"/></p>",
      "<p>Account A administrator user attaches a bucket policy granting Account B conditional permission to upload objects.<br/> <br/>Account A administrator creates an lAM role, establishing trust with Account C, so users in that account can access Account A. The access policy attached to the role limits what user in Account C can do when the user accesses Account A.<br/> <br/>Account B administrator uploads an object to the bucket owned by Account A, granting full-control permission to the bucket owner.<br/> <br/>Account C administrator creates a user and attaches a user policy that al lows the user to assume the role.<br/> <br/>User in Account C first assumes the role, which returns the user temporary security credentials.<br/> <br/>Using those temporary credentials, the user then accesses objects in the bucket.<br/> <br/>For this example, you need three accounts. The following tab le shows how we refer to these accounts and the administrator users in these accounts. Per lAM guidelines (see About Using an<br/> <br/>Administrator User to Create Resources and Grant Permissions) we do not use the account root credentials in this walkthrough. Instead, you create an administrator user in each account and use those credentials in creating resources and granting them permissions </p>",

A content delivery network or content distribution network (CDN) is a large distributed system of servers deployed in multiple data centers across the world. The location of the data center used for CDN is called edge location.<br/> <br/>Amazon CloudFront can cache static content at each edge location. This means that your popular static content (e.g., your site’s logo, navigational images, cascading style sheets, JavaScript code, etc.) will be available at a nearby edge location for the browsers to download with low latency and improved performance for viewers. Caching popular static content with Amazon CloudFront also helps you offload requests for such files from your origin sever C CloudFront serves the cached copy when available and only makes a request to your origin server if the edge location receiving the browser’s request does not have a copy of the file.<br/> <br/>Reference: http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/</p>",

      "<p class=\"collapse exam_answer\" id=\"exam_question_1\" style=\"clear: both;\"><strong>Answer: </strong>C<br/> <br/>Explanation:<br/> <br/>Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployments provide enhanced availability and durability for Database (DB) Instances, making them a natural fit for production database workloads. When you provision a Multi-AZ DB Instance, Amazon RDS automatically creates a primary DB Instance and synchronously replicates the data to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone (AZ). Each AZ runs on its own physically distinct, independent infrastructure, and is engineered to be highly reliable. In case of an infrastructure failure (for example, instance hardware failure, storage failure, or network disruption),Amazon RDS performs an automatic failover to the standby, so that you can resume database operations as soon as the failover is complete. Since the endpoint for your DB Instance remains the same after a failover, your application can resume database operation without the need for manual administrative intervention.<br/> <br/>Benefits<br/> <br/>Enhanced Durability<br/> <br/>Multi-AZ deployments for the MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL engines utilize synchronous physical replication to keep data on the standby up-to-date with the primary. Multi-AZ deployments for the SQL Server engine use synchronous logical replication to achieve the same result, employing SQL Server-native Mirroring technology. Both approaches safeguard your data in the event of a DB Instance failure or loss of an Availability Zone.<br/> <br/>If a storage volume on your primary fails in a Multi-AZ deployment, Amazon RDS automatically initiates a failover to the up-to-date standby. Compare this to a Single-AZ deployment: in case of a Single-AZ database failure, a user-initiated point-in-time-restore operation will be required. This operation can take several hours to complete, and any data updates that occurred after the latest restorable time (typically within the last five minutes) will not be available.<br/> <br/>Amazon Aurora employs a highly durable, SSD-backed virtualized storage layer purpose-built for database workloads. Amazon Aurora automatically replicates your volume six ways, across three Availability Zones. Amazon Aurora storage is fault-tolerant, transparently handling the loss of up to two copies of data without affecting database write availability and up to three copies without affecting read availability. Amazon Aurora storage is also self-healing. Data blocks and disks are continuously scanned for errors and replaced automatically.<br/> <br/>Increased Availability<br/> <br/>You also benefit from enhanced database availability when running Multi-AZ deployments. If an Availability Zone failure or DB Instance failure occurs, your availability impact is limited to the time automatic failover takes to complete: typically under one minute for Amazon Aurora and one to two minutes for other database engines (see the RDS FAQ for details).<br/> <br/>The availability benefits of Multi-AZ deployments also extend to planned maintenance and backups.<br/> <br/>In the case of system upgrades like OS patching or DB Instance scaling, these operations are applied first on the standby, prior to the automatic failover. As a result, your availability impact is, again, only the time required for automatic fail over to complete.<br/> <br/>Unlike Single-AZ deployments, 1/0 activity is not suspended on your primary during backup for Multi-AZ deployments for the MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL engines, because the backup is taken from the standby.<br/> <br/>However, note that you may still experience elevated latencies for a few minutes during backups for Multi-AZ deployments.<br/> <br/>On instance failure in Amazon Aurora deployments, Amazon RDS uses RDS Multi-AZ technology to automate failover to one of up to 15 Amazon Aurora Replicas you have created in any of three Availability Zones. If no Amazon Aurora Replicas have been provisioned, in the case of a failure, Amazon RDS will attempt to create a new Amazon Aurora DB instance for you automatically.<br/> <br/>No Administrative Intervention<br/> <br/>DB Instance failover is fully automatic and requires no administrative intervention. Amazon RDS monitors the health of your primary and standbys, and initiates a failover automatically in response to avariety of failure conditions.<br/> <br/>Failover conditions<br/> <br/>Amazon RDS detects and automatically recovers from the most common failure scenarios for Multi-AZ deployments so that you can resume database operations as quickly as possible without administrative intervention. Amazon RDS automatically performs a failover in the event of any of the following:<br/> <br/>Loss of availability in primary Availability Zone<br/> <br/>Loss of network connectivity to primary<br/> <br/>Compute unit failure on primary<br/> <br/>Storage failure on primary<br/> <br/>Note: When operations such as DB Instance scaling or system upgrades like OS patching are initiated for Multi-AZ deployments, for enhanced availability, they are applied first on the standby prior to an automatic failover. As a result, your availability impact is limited only to the time required for automatic failover to complete. Note that Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployments do not failover automatically in response to database operations such as long running queries, deadlocks or database corruption errors.</p>",

Anyone who has the access key for your root account has unrestricted access to all the resources in your account, including billing information.<br/> <br/>One of the best ways to protect your account is to not have an access key for your root account. We recommend that unless you must have a root access key (this is very rare), that you do not generate one. Instead, AWS best practice is to create one or more AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users, give them the necessary permissions, and use IAM users for everyday interaction with AWS.<br/> <br/>Reference: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-access-keys-best-practices.html#root-password</p>",

This is because all RAID is accomplished at the software level. For greater I/O performance than you can achieve with a single volume, RAID 0 can stripe multiple volumes together; for on-instance redundancy, RAID 1 can mirror two volumes together.<br/> <br/>RAID 5 and RAID 6 are not recommended for Amazon EBS because the parity write operations of these RAID modes consume some of the IOPS available to your volumes.<br/> <br/>Reference: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/raid-config.html</p>",

Amazon Glacier is designed to provide average annual durability of 99.999999999% for an archive. It stores each archive in multiple facilities and multiple devices. Unlike traditional systems which can require laborious data verification and manual repair, Glacier performs regular, systematic data integrity checks, and is built to be automatically self-healing.<br/> <br/>Reference: http://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/Security/AWS%20Security%20Whitepaper.pdf</p>",

Amazon EMR customers can also choose to send data to Amazon S3 using the HTTPS protocol for secure transmission. In addition, Amazon EMR always uses HTTPS to send data between Amazon S3 and Amazon EC2. For added security, customers may encrypt the input data before they upload it to Amazon S3 (using any common data compression tool); they then need to add a decryption step to the beginning of their cluster when Amazon EMR fetches the data from Amazon S3.<br/> <br/>Reference: https://aws.amazon.com/elasticmapreduce/faqs/</p>",

      "<p class=\"collapse exam_answer\" id=\"exam_question_1\" style=\"clear: both;\"><strong>Answer: </strong>A<br/> <br/>Explanation:<br/> <br/>Point-In-Time Recovery<br/> <br/>In addition to the daily automated backup, Amazon RDS archives database change logs. This enables you to recover your database to any point in time during the backup retention period, up to the last five minutes of database usage.<br/> <br/>Amazon RDS stores multiple copies of your data, but for Single-AZ DB instances these copies are stored in a single availability zone. If for any reason a Single-AZ DB instance becomes unusable, you can use point-in-time recovery to launch a new DB instance with the latest restorable data. For more information on working with point-in-time recovery, go to Restoring a DB Instance to a Specified Time.<br/> <br/>Note<br/> <br/>Multi-AZ deployments store copies of your data in different Availability Zones for greater levels of data durability.

      "<p class=\"collapse exam_answer\" id=\"exam_question_1\" style=\"clear: both;\"><strong>Answer: </strong>B<br/> <br/>Explanation:<br/> <br/>Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) offers a reliable, highly scalable hosted queue for storing messages as they travel between computers. By using Amazon SQS, developers can simply move data between distributed application components performing different tasks, without losing messages or requiring each component to be always available. Amazon SQS makes it easy to build a distributed, decoupled application, working in close conjunction with the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) and the other AWS infrastructure web services.<br/> <br/>What can I do with Amazon SQS?<br/> <br/>Amazon SQS is a web service that gives you access to a message queue that can be used to store messages while waiting for a computer to process them. This allows you to quickly build message queuing applications that can be run on any computer on the internet. Since Amazon SQS is highly scalable and you only pay for what you use, you can start small and grow your application as you wish, with no compromise on performance or reliability. This lets you focus on building sophisticated message-based applications, without worrying about how the messages are stored and managed.<br/> <br/>You can use Amazon SQS with software applications in various ways. For example, you can: Integrate Amazon SQS with other AWS infrastructure web services to make applications more reliable and flexible.<br/> <br/>Use Amazon SQS to create a queue of work where each message is a task that needs to be completed by a process. One or many computers can read tasks from the queue and perform them. Build amicroservices architecture, using queues to connect your microservices.<br/> <br/>Keep notifications of significant events in a business process in an Amazon SQS queue. Each event can have a corresponding message in a queue, and applications that need to be aware of the event can read and process the messages.</p>",

      "<p class=\"collapse exam_answer\" id=\"exam_question_1\" style=\"clear: both;\"><strong>Answer: </strong>B<br/> <br/>Explanation:<br/> <br/>Working with volumes<br/> <br/>When an API action requires a caller to specify multiple resources, you must create a policy statement that allows users to access all required resources. If you need to use a Condition element with one or more of these resources, you must create multiple statements as shown in this example.<br/> <br/>The following policy allows users to attach volumes with the tag \"volume_user=iam-user-name\" to instances with the tag \"department=dev\", and to detach those volumes from those instances. If youattach this policy to an lAM group, the aws: username policy variable gives each lAM user in the group permission to attach or detach volumes from the instances with a tag named volume_ user that has his or her lAM user name as a value.<br/> <br/>{<br/> <br/>\"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",<br/> <br/>\"Statement\": [{<br/> <br/>\"Effect\": \"Allow\",<br/> <br/>\"Action\": [<br/> <br/>\"ec2: AttachVolume\",<br/> <br/>\"ec2: DetachVolume\"<br/> <br/>],<br/> <br/>\"Resource\": \"arn: aws: ec2: us-east-1:123456789012: instanee/*\",<br/> <br/>\"Condition\": {<br/> <br/>\"StringEquals\": {<br/> <br/>\"ec2: ResourceTag/department\": \"dev\"<br/> <br/>}<br/> <br/>}<br/> <br/>},<br/> <br/>{<br/> <br/>\"Effect\": \"Allow\",<br/> <br/>\"Action\": [<br/> <br/>\"ec2: AttachVolume\",<br/> <br/>\"ec2: DetachVolume\"<br/> <br/>],<br/> <br/>\"Resource\": \"arn: aws: ec2: us-east-1:123456789012: volume/*\",<br/> <br/>\"Condition\": {<br/> <br/>\"StringEquals\": {<br/> <br/>\"ec2: ResourceTag/volume_user\": \"${aws:username}\"<br/> <br/>}<br/> <br/>}<br/> <br/>}<br/> <br/>]<br/> <br/>}<br/> <br/>Launching instances (Runlnstances)<br/> <br/>The Runlnstances API action launches one or more instances. Runlnstances requires an AMI and creates an instance; and users can specify a key pair and security group in the request. Launching into EC2-VPC requires a subnet, and creates a network interface. Launching from an Amazon EBS-backed AMI creates a volume. Therefore, the user must have permission to use these Amazon EC2resources. The caller can also configure the instance using optional parameters to Run Instances, such as the instance type and a subnet. You can create a policy statement that requires users to specify an optional parameter, or restricts users to particular values for a parameter. The examples in this section demonstrate some of the many possible ways that you can control the configuration of an instance that a user can launch.<br/> <br/>Note that by default, users don’t have permission to describe, start, stop, or terminate the resulting instances. One way to grant the users permission to manage the resulting instances is to create aspecific tag for each instance, and then create a statement that enables them to manage instances with that tag. For more information, see 2: Working with instances.<br/> <br/>a. AMI<br/> <br/>The following policy allows users to launch instances using only the AMIs that have the specified tag, \"department=dev\", associated with them. The users can’t launch instances using other AM Is because the Condition element of the first statement requires that users specify an AMI that has this tag. The users also can’t launch into a subnet, as the policy does not grant permissions for the subnet and network interface resources. They can, however, launch into EC2-Ciassic. The second statement uses a wildcard to enable users to create instance resources, and requires users to specify the key pair<br/> <br/>project_keypair and the security group sg-1a2b3c4d. Users are still able to launch instances without a key pair.<br/> <br/>{<br/> <br/>\"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",<br/> <br/>\"Statement\": [{<br/> <br/>},<br/> <br/>{<br/> <br/>\"Effect\": \"Allow\",<br/> <br/>\"Action\": \"ec2: Runlnstances\",<br/> <br/>\"Resource\": [<br/> <br/>\"arn:aws:ec2:region::image/ami-*\"<br/> <br/>],<br/> <br/>\"Condition\": {<br/> <br/>\"StringEquals\": {<br/> <br/>\"ec2: ResourceTag/department\": \"dev\"<br/> <br/>}<br/> <br/>}<br/> <br/>},<br/> <br/>{<br/> <br/>\"Effect\": \"Allow\",<br/> <br/>\"Action\": \"ec2: Runlnstances\",<br/> <br/>\"Resource\": [<br/> <br/>\"arn:aws:ec2:region:account:instance/*\",<br/> <br/>\"arn:aws:ec2:region:account:volume/*\",<br/> <br/>\"arn:aws:ec2:region:account:key-pair/project_keypair\",<br/> <br/>\"arn :aws :ec2: region: account:security-group/sg-1a 2b3c4d\"<br/> <br/>]<br/> <br/>}<br/> <br/>]<br/> <br/>}<br/> <br/>Alternatively, the following policy allows users to launch instances using only the specified AMIs, ami-9e1670f7 and ami-45cf5c3c.

      "<p class=\"collapse exam_answer\" id=\"exam_question_1\" style=\"clear: both;\"><strong>Answer: </strong>A<br/> <br/>Explanation:<br/> <br/>Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a managed service that makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity, while managing time-consuming database administration tasks, freeing you up to focus on your applications and business.<br/> <br/>When you create or modify your DB Instance to run as a Multi-AZ deployment, Amazon RDS automatically provisions and maintains a synchronous “standby” replica in a different Availability Zone.<br/> <br/>Updates to your DB Instance are synchronously replicated across Availability Zones to the standby in order to keep both in sync and protect your latest database updates against DB Instance failure.<br/> <br/>During certain types of planned maintenance, or in the unlikely event of DB Instance failure or Availability Zone failure, Amazon RDS will automatically failover to the standby so that you can resume database writes and reads as soon as the standby is promoted. Since the name record for your DB Instance remains the same, you application can resume database operation without the need for manual administrative intervention. With Multi-AZ deployments, replication is transparent: you do not interact directly with the standby, and it cannot be used to serve read traffic. If you are using Amazon RDS for MySQL and are looking to scale read traffic beyond the capacity constraints of a single DB Instance, you can deploy one or more Read Replicas.<br/> <br/>Reference: http://aws.amazon.com/rds/faqs/</p>",

      "<p class=\"collapse exam_answer\" id=\"exam_question_1\" style=\"clear: both;\"><strong>Answer: </strong>A<br/> <br/>Explanation:<br/> <br/>Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. Amazon DynamoDB enables customers to offload the administrative burdens of operating and scaling distributed databases to AWS, so they don’t have to worry about hardware provisioning, setup and configuration, replication, software patching, or cluster scaling.<br/> <br/>Today’s web-based applications generate and consume massive amounts of data. For example, an online game might start out with only a few thousand users and a light database workload consisting of 10 writes per second and 50 reads per second.<br/> <br/>However, if the game becomes successful, it may rapidly grow to millions of users and generate tens (or even hundreds) of thousands of writes and reads per second. It may also create terabytes or more of data per day. Developing your applications against Amazon DynamoDB enables you to start small and simply dial-up your request capacity for a table as your requirements scale, without incurring downtime. You pay highly cost-efficient rates for the request capacity you provision, and let Amazon DynamoDB do the work over partitioning your data and traffic over sufficient server capacity to meet your needs. Amazon DynamoDB does the database management and administration, and you simply store and request your data. Automatic replication and failover provides built-in fault tolerance, high availability, and data durability. Amazon DynamoDB gives you the peace of mind that your database is fully managed and can grow with your application requirements.<br/> <br/>Reference: http://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/faqs/</p>",

      "<p class=\"collapse exam_answer\" id=\"exam_question_1\" style=\"clear: both;\"><strong>Answer: </strong>A, D, F<br/> <br/>Explanation:<br/> <br/>AWS Direct Connect<br/> <br/>AWS Direct Connect makes it easy to establish a dedicated network connection from your premises to AWS. Using AWS Direct Connect, you can establish private connectivity between AWS you’re your datacenter, office, or colocation environment, which in many cases can reduce your network costs, increase bandwidth throughput, and provide a more consistent network experience than Internet based connections.<br/> <br/>AWS Direct Connect lets you establish a dedicated network connection between your network and one of the AWS Direct Connect locations. Using industry standard 802.1q VLANs, this dedicated connection can be partitioned into multiple virtual interfaces. This allows you to use the same connection to access public resources such as objects stored in Amazon 53 using public IP address space, and private resources such as Amazon EC2 instances running within an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) using private IP space, while maintaining network separation between the public and private environments. Virtual interfaces can be reconfigured at any time to meet your changing needs.<br/> <br/>What is AWS Direct Connect?<br/> <br/>AWS Direct Connect links your internal network to an AWS Direct Connect location over a standard 1 gigabit or 10 gigabit Ethernet fiber-optic cable. One end of the cab le is connected to your router, the other to an AWS Direct Connect router. With this connection in place, you can create virtual interfaces directly to the AWS cloud (for example, to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud {Amazon EC2) and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon 53)) and to Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), bypassing Internet service providers in your network path. An AWS Direct Connect location provides access to Amazon Web Services in the region it is associated with, as well as access to other US regions. For example, you can provision a single connection to any AWS Direct Connect location in the US and use it to access public AWS services in all US Regions and AWS GovCloud (US).<br/> <br/>The following diagram shows how AWS Direct Connect interfaces with your network. </p>",

      "<p>Requirements<br/> <br/>To use AWS Direct Connect, your network must meet one of the following conditions:<br/> <br/>Your network is colocated with an existing AWS Direct Connect location. For more information on available AWS Direct Connect locations, go to http://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/.<br/> <br/>You are working with an AWS Direct Connect partner who is a member of the AWS Partner Network (APN). For a list of AWS Direct Connect partners who can help you connect, go to<br/> <br/>http://aws.amazon.com/directconnect<br/> <br/>You are working with an independent service provider to connect to AWS Direct Connect.<br/> <br/>In addition, your network must meet the following conditions:<br/> <br/>Connections to AWS Direct Connect require single mode fiber, 1000BASE-LX (1310nm) for 1 gigabit Ethernet, or 10GBASE-LR {1310nm) for 10 gigabit Ethernet. Auto Negotiation for the port must bedisabled. You must support 802.1Q VLANs across these connections.<br/> <br/>Your network must support Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) and BGP MD5 authentication. Optionally, you may configure Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD).<br/> <br/>To connect to Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), you must first do the following:<br/> <br/>Provide a private Autonomous System Number (ASN). Amazon allocates a private IP address in the 169.x.x.x range to you.<br/> <br/>Create a virtual private gateway and attach it to your VPC. For more information about creating a virtual private gateway, see Adding a Hardware Virtual Private Gateway to Your VPC in the AmazonVPC User Guide.<br/> <br/>To connect to public AWS products such as Amazon EC2 and Amazon 53, you need to provide the following:<br/> <br/>A public ASN that you own (preferred) or a private ASN.<br/> <br/>Public IP addresses (/31) (that is, one for each end of the BGP session) for each BGP session. If you do not have public I P addresses to assign to this connection, log on to AWS and then open a ticket with AWS Support.<br/> <br/>The public routes that you will advertise over BGP.</p>",

      "<p class=\"collapse exam_answer\" id=\"exam_question_1\" style=\"clear: both;\"><strong>Answer: </strong>C<br/> <br/>Explanation:<br/> <br/>There is no such thing as \"Most appropriate\" without knowing all your goals. I find your scenarios very fuzzy, since you can obviously mix-n-match between them.<br/> <br/>I think you should decide by layers instead:<br/> <br/>Load Balancer Layer: ELB or just DNS, or roll-your-own. (Using DNS+EIPs is slightly cheaper, but less reliable than ELB.)<br/> <br/>Storage Layer for 17TB of Images: This is the perfect use case for 53. Off-load all the web requests directly to the relevant JPEGs in 53. Your EC2 boxes just generate links to them.<br/> <br/>If your app already serves it’s own images (not links to images), you might start with EFS. But more than likely, you can just setup a web server to re-write or re-direct all JPEG links to 53 pretty easily.<br/> <br/>If you use 53, don’t serve directly from the bucket- Serve via a CNAME in domain you control. That way, you can switch in CloudFront easily.<br/> <br/>EBS will be way more expensive, and you’ll need 2x the drives if you need 2 boxes. Yuck. Consider a smaller storage format. For example, JPEG200 or WebP or other tools might make for smaller images. There is also the DejaVu format from a while back.<br/> <br/>Cache Layer: Adding Cloud Front in front of 53 will help people on the other side of the world– well, possibly. Typical archives follow a power law. The long tail of requests means that most JPEGs won’tbe requested enough to be in the cache. So you are only speeding up the most popular objects. You can always wait, and switch in CF later after you know your costs better. (In some cases, it canactually lower costs.)<br/> <br/>You can also put CloudFront in front of your app, since your archive search results should be fairly static.<br/> <br/>This will also allow you to run with a smaller instance type, since CF will handle much of the load if you do it right.<br/> <br/>Database Layer: A few options:<br/> <br/>Use whatever your current server does for now, and replace with something else down the road.<br/> <br/>Don’t under-estimate this approach, sometimes it’s better to start now and optimize later.<br/> <br/>Use RDS to run MySQL/ Postgres<br/> <br/>I’m not as familiar with ElasticSearch I Cloudsearch, but obviously Cloudsearch will be less maintenance+setup.<br/> <br/>App Layer:<br/> <br/>When creating the app layer from scratch, consider Cloud Formation and/or OpsWorks. It’s extra stuff to learn, but helps down the road.<br/> <br/>Java+ Tomcat is right up the alley of ElasticBeanstalk. (Basically EC2 + Autoscale + ELB).<br/> <br/>Preventing Abuse: When you put something in a public 53 bucket, people will hot-link it from their web pages. If you want to prevent that, your app on the EC2 box can generate signed links to 53 thatexpire in a few hours. Now everyone will be forced to go thru the app, and the app can apply rate limiting, etc.<br/> <br/>Saving money: If you don’t mind having downtime:<br/> <br/>run everything in one AZ (both DBs and EC2s). You can always add servers and AZs down the road, as long as it’s architected to be stateless. In fact, you should use multiple regions if you want it to bereally robust.<br/> <br/>use Reduced Redundancy in 53 to save a few hundred bucks per month (Someone will have to \"go fix it\" every time it breaks, including having an off-line copy to repair 53.)<br/> <br/>Buy Reserved Instances on your EC2 boxes to make them cheaper. (Start with the Rl market and buy a partially used one to get started.) It’s just a coupon saying \"if you run this type of box in this AZ, you will save on the per-hour costs.\" You can get 1/2 to 1/3 off easily.<br/> <br/>Rewrite the application to use less memory and CPU -that way you can run on fewer/ smaller boxes.<br/> <br/>(May or may not be worth the investment.)<br/> <br/>If your app will be used very infrequently, you will save a lot of money by using Lambda. I’d be worried that it would be quite slow if you tried to run a Java application on it though..<br/> <br/>We’re missing some information like load, latency expectations from search, indexing speed, size of the search index, etc. But with what you’ve given us, I would go with 53 as the storage for the files (53 rocks. It is really, really awesome). If you’re stuck with the commercial search application, then on EC2 instances with autoscaling and an ELB. If you are allowed an alternative search engine, Elasticsearch is probably your best bet. I’d run it on EC2 instead of the AWS Elasticsearch service, as IMHO it’s not ready yet. Don’t autoscale Elasticsearch automatically though, it’ll cause all sorts ofissues. I have zero experience with CloudSearch so I can’t comment on that. Regardless of which option, I’d use Cloud Formation for all of it.</p>",

This ensures that all requests coming from the user during the session will be sent to the same application instance.<br/> <br/>The key to managing the sticky session is determining how long your load balancer should consistently route the user’s request to the same application instance. If your application has its own session cookie, then you can set Elastic Load Balancing to create the session cookie to follow the duration specified by the application’s session cookie. If your application does not have its own session cookie, then you can set Elastic Load Balancing to create a session cookie by specifying your own stickiness duration. You can associate stickiness duration for only HTTP/HTTPS load balancer listeners.<br/> <br/>An application instance must always receive and send two cookies: A cookie that defines the stickiness duration and a special Elastic Load Balancing cookie named AWSELB, that has the mapping to the application instance.<br/> <br/>Reference: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/TerminologyandKeyConcepts.html#session-stickiness</p>",

      "<p>AWS CloudFormation is a service that helps you model and set up your Amazon Web Services resources so that you can spend less time managing those resources and more time focusing on your applications that run in AWS. You create a template that describes all the AWS resources that you want (like Amazon EC2 instances or Amazon RDS DB instances), and AWS CloudFormation takes care of provisioning and configuring those resources for you.<br/> <br/>What formatting is required for this template?<br/><span class=\"correct_answer\">A .  JSON-formatted document</span><br/>B .  CSS-formatted document<br/>C .  XML-formatted document<br/>D .  HTML-formatted document</p>",

      "<p class=\"collapse exam_answer\" id=\"exam_question_1\" style=\"clear: both;\"><strong>Answer: </strong>B<br/> <br/>Explanation:<br/> <br/>With AWS IAM a user is creating an application which runs on an EC2 instance and makes requests to AWS, such as DynamoDB or S3 calls. Here it is recommended that the user should not create an IAM user and pass the user’s credentials to the application or embed those credentials inside the application. Instead, the user should use roles for EC2 and give that role access to DynamoDB /S3. When the roles are attached to EC2, it will give temporary security credentials to the application hosted on that EC2, to connect with DynamoDB / S3.<br/> <br/>Reference: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_WorkingWithGroupsAndUsers.html</p>",

If your source DB Instance cannot take I/O requests (e.g. due to I/O suspension for backups or scheduled maintenance), you can direct read traffic to your Read Replica(s).

      "<p class=\"collapse exam_answer\" id=\"exam_question_1\" style=\"clear: both;\"><strong>Answer: </strong>A<br/> <br/>Explanation:<br/> <br/>You can choose between three EBS volume types to best meet the needs of their workloads: General Purpose (SSD), Provisioned IOPS (SSD), and Magnetic. General Purpose (SSD) is the new, SSD-backed, general purpose EBS volume type that we recommend as the default choice for customers. General Purpose (SSD) volumes are suitable for a broad range of workloads, including small to medium sized databases, development and test environments, and boot volumes. Provisioned IOPS (SSD) volumes offer storage with consistent and low-latency performance, and are designed for I/O intensive applications such as large relational or NoSQL databases. Magnetic volumes provide the lowest cost per gigabyte of all EBS volume types. Magnetic volumes are ideal for workloads where data is accessed infrequently, and applications where the lowest storage cost is important.<br/> <br/>Reference: https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/faqs/</p>",

      "<p class=\"collapse exam_answer\" id=\"exam_question_1\" style=\"clear: both;\"><strong>Answer: </strong>A<br/> <br/>Explanation:<br/> <br/>Overview of Creating Amazon EBS-Backed AMIs<br/> <br/>First, launch an instance from an AMI that’s similar to the AMI that you’d like to create. You can connect to your instance and customize it. When the instance is configured correctly, ensure data integrity by stopping the instance before you create an AMI, then create the image. When you create an Amazon EBS-backed AMI, we automatically register it for you.<br/> <br/>Amazon EC2 powers down the instance before creating the AMI to ensure that everything on the instance is stopped and in a consistent state during the creation process. If you’re confident that your instance is in a consistent state appropriate for AMI creation, you can tell Amazon EC2 not to power down and reboot the instance. Some file systems, such as XFS, can freeze and unfreeze activity, making it safe to create the image without rebooting the instance.<br/> <br/>During the AMI-creation process, Amazon EC2 creates snapshots of your instance’s root volume and any other EBS volumes attached to your instance. If any volumes attached to the instance are encrypted, the new AMI only launches successfully on instances that support Amazon EBS encryption. For more information, see Amazon EBS Encryption.<br/> <br/>Depending on the size of the volumes, it can take several minutes for the AMI-creation process to complete (sometimes up to 24 hours).You may find it more efficient to create snapshots of your volumes prior to creating your AMI. This way, only small, incremental snapshots need to be created when the AMI is created, and the process completes more quickly (the total time for snapshot creation remains the same). For more information, see Creating an Amazon EBS Snapshot.<br/> <br/>After the process completes, you have a new AMI and snapshot created from the root volume of the instance. When you launch an instance using the new AMI, we create a new EBS volume for its root volume using the snapshot. Both the AMI and the snapshot incur charges to your account until youdelete them. For more information, see Deregistering Your AMI.<br/> <br/>If you add instance-store volumes or EBS volumes to your instance in addition to the root device volume, the block device mapping for the new AMI contains information for these volumes, and the block device mappings for instances that you launch from the new AMI automatically contain information for these volumes. The instance-store volumes specified in the block device mapping for the new instance are new and don’t contain any data from the instance store volumes of the instance you used to create the AMI. The data on EBS volumes persists. For more information, see Block Device Mapping.</p>",

      "<p class=\"collapse exam_answer\" id=\"exam_question_1\" style=\"clear: both;\"><strong>Answer: </strong>B<br/> <br/>Explanation:<br/> <br/>Amazon S3 supports several mechanisms that give you flexibility to control who can access your data as well as how, when, and where they can access it. Amazon S3 provides four different access control mechanisms: AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies, Access Control Lists (ACLs), bucket policies, and query string authentication. IAM enables organizations to create and manage multiple users under a single AWS account. With IAM policies, you can grant IAM users fine-grained control to your Amazon S3 bucket or objects. You can use ACLs to selectively add (grant) certain permissions on individual objects.<br/> <br/>Amazon S3 bucket policies can be used to add or deny permissions across some or all of the objects within a single bucket.<br/> <br/>With Query string authentication, you have the ability to share Amazon S3 objects through URLs that are valid for a specified period of time.<br/> <br/>Reference: http://aws.amazon.com/s3/details/#security</p>",

      "<p class=\"collapse exam_answer\" id=\"exam_question_1\" style=\"clear: both;\"><strong>Answer: </strong>C<br/> <br/>Explanation:<br/> <br/>When a user sends a request to ELB over HTTP/HTTPS, the request header log at the instance will only receive the IP of ELB. This is because ELB is the interceptor between the EC2 instance and the client request. To get the client IP, use the header X-Forwarded-For in header. The client IP address in the X-Forwarded-For request header is followed by the IP addresses of each successive proxy that passes along the request. The last IP address is the IP address that connects to the back-end application instance. e.g. if the HTTP request already has a header when it reaches the Load Balancer, the IP address from which the request came is appended at the end of the header followed by the IP address of the Load Balancer. In such cases, the X-Forwarded-For request header takes the following form: X-Forwarded-For: clientIPAddress, previousRequestIPAddress, LoadBalancerIPAddress.<br/> <br/>Reference: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/TerminologyandKeyConcepts.html</p>",

      "<p class=\"collapse exam_answer\" id=\"exam_question_1\" style=\"clear: both;\"><strong>Answer: </strong>B<br/> <br/>Explanation:<br/> <br/>A placement group is a logical grouping of instances within a single Availability Zone. Using placement groups enables applications to participate in a low-latency, 10 Gbps network. Placement groups are recommended for applications that benefit from low network latency, high network throughput, or both. To provide the lowest latency, and the highest packet-per-second network performance for your placement group, choose an instance type that supports enhanced networking.<br/> <br/>Placement groups have the following limitations:<br/> <br/>The name you specify for a placement group a name must be unique within your AWS account.<br/> <br/>A placement group can’t span multiple Availability Zones.<br/> <br/>Although launching multiple instance types into a placement group is possible, this reduces the likelihood that the required capacity will be available for your launch to succeed. We recommend using the same instance type for all instances in a placement group.<br/> <br/>You can’t merge placement groups. Instead, you must terminate the instances in one placement group, and then relaunch those instances into the other placement group.<br/> <br/>A placement group can span peered VPCs; however, you will not get full-bisection bandwidth between instances in peered VPCs. For more information about VPC peering connections, see VPC Peering in the Amazon VPC User Guide.<br/> <br/>You can’t move an existing instance into a placement group. You can create an AMI from your existing instance, and then launch a new instance from the AMI into a placement group.<br/> <br/>Reference: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html</p>",

      "<p class=\"collapse exam_answer\" id=\"exam_question_1\" style=\"clear: both;\"><strong>Answer: </strong>C<br/> <br/>Explanation:<br/> <br/>Auto Scaling is an AWS service that allows you to increase or decrease the number of EC2 instances within your application’s architecture. With Auto Scaling, you create collections of EC2 instances, called Auto Scaling groups. You can create these groups from scratch, or from existing EC2 instances that are already in production.<br/> <br/>Reference: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html#limits_autoscaling</p>",

      "<p class=\"collapse exam_answer\" id=\"exam_question_1\" style=\"clear: both;\"><strong>Answer: </strong>C<br/> <br/>Explanation:<br/> <br/>Auto Scaling periodically performs health checks on the instances in your group and replaces instances that fail these checks. By default, these health checks use the results of EC2 instance status checks to determine the health of an instance. If you use a load balancer with your Auto Scaling group, you can optionally choose to include the results of Elastic Load Balancing health checks.<br/> <br/>Auto Scaling marks an instance unhealthy if the calls to the Amazon EC2 action DescribeInstanceStatus returns any other state other than running, the system status shows impaired, or the calls to Elastic Load Balancing action DescribeInstanceHealth returns OutOfService in the instance state field.<br/> <br/>After an instance is marked unhealthy because of an Amazon EC2 or Elastic Load Balancing health check, it is scheduled for replacement.<br/> <br/>You can customize the health check conducted by your Auto Scaling group by specifying additional checks or by having your own health check system and then sending the instance’s health information directly from your system to Auto Scaling.<br/> <br/>Reference: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AutoScaling/latest/DeveloperGuide/healthcheck.html</p>",

      "<p class=\"collapse exam_answer\" id=\"exam_question_1\" style=\"clear: both;\"><strong>Answer: </strong>C<br/> <br/>Explanation:<br/> <br/>Amazon RDS allows you to use read replicas with Multi-AZ deployments. In Multi-AZ deployments for MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and PostgreSQL, the data in your primary DB Instance is synchronously replicated to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone (AZ). Because of their synchronous replication, Multi-AZ deployments for these engines offer greater data durability benefits than do read replicas. (In all Amazon RDS for Aurora deployments, your data is automatically replicated across 3 Availability Zones.)<br/> <br/>You can use Multi-AZ deployments and read replicas in conjunction to enjoy the complementary benefits of each. You can simply specify that a given Multi-AZ deployment is the source DB Instance for your Read replicas. That way you gain both the data durability and availability benefits of Multi CAZ deployments and the read scaling benefits of read replicas.<br/> <br/>Note that for Multi-AZ deployments, you have the option to create your read replica in an AZ other than that of the primary and the standby for even more redundancy. You can identify the AZ corresponding to your standby by looking at the \"Secondary Zone\" field of your DB Instance in the AWS Management Console.</p>",

      "<p class=\"collapse exam_answer\" id=\"exam_question_1\" style=\"clear: both;\"><strong>Answer: </strong>C<br/> <br/>Explanation:<br/> <br/>Auto Scaling can start and stop the instance at a pre-defined time. Here, the total running time is unknown. Thus, the user has to use the CloudWatch alarm, which monitors the CPU utilization. The user can create an alarm that is triggered when the average CPU utilization percentage has been lower than 10 percent for 24 hours, signaling that it is idle and no longer in use. When the utilization is below the threshold limit, it will terminate the instance as a part of the instance action.<br/> <br/>Reference: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/UsingAlarmActions.html</p>",

      "<p class=\"collapse exam_answer\" id=\"exam_question_1\" style=\"clear: both;\"><strong>Answer: </strong>C<br/> <br/>Explanation:<br/> <br/>Before you start using Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), you have to configure the listeners for your load balancer. A listener is a process that listens for connection requests. It is configured with a protocol and a port number for front-end (client to load balancer) and back-end (load balancer to back-end instance) connections.<br/> <br/>Elastic Load Balancing supports the load balancing of applications using HTTP, HTTPS (secure HTTP), TCP, and SSL (secure TCP) protocols. The HTTPS uses the SSL protocol to establish secure connections over the HTTP layer. You can also use SSL protocol to establish secure connections over the TCP layer.<br/> <br/>The acceptable ports for both HTTPS/SSL and HTTP/TCP connections are 25, 80, 443, 465, 587, and 1024-65535.<br/> <br/>Reference: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/elb-listener-config.html</p>",

A user can create a subnet with VPC and launch instances inside that subnet. When the user is launching an instance he needs to select an option which attaches a public IP to the instance. If the user has not selected the option to attach the public IP then it will only have a private IP when launched. If the user wants to connect to an instance from the internet he should create an elastic IP with VPC.

The encryption occurs on the servers that host the EC2 instances, providing encryption of data as it moves between EC2 instances and EBS storage.

Amazon EBS encryption is available for all the latest EC2 instances in all commercially available AWS regions.<br/> <br/>Reference: https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2014/05/21/Amazon-EBS-encryption-now-available/</p>",

      "<p class=\"collapse exam_answer\" id=\"exam_question_1\" style=\"clear: both;\"><strong>Answer: </strong>C<br/> <br/>Explanation:<br/> <br/>In EBS workload demand plays an important role in getting the most out of your General Purpose (SSD) and Provisioned IOPS (SSD) volumes. In order for your volumes to deliver the amount of IOPS that are available, they need to have enough I/O requests sent to them. There is a relationship between the demand on the volumes, the amount of IOPS that are available to them, and the latency of the request (the amount of time it takes for the I/O operation to complete).<br/> <br/>Latency is the true end-to-end client time of an I/O operation; in other words, when the client sends a IO, how long does it take to get an acknowledgement from the storage subsystem that the IO read or write is complete.<br/> <br/>If your I/O latency is higher than you require, check your average queue length to make sure that your application is not trying to drive more IOPS than you have provisioned. You can maintain high IOPS while keeping latency down by maintaining a low average queue length (which is achieved by provisioning more IOPS for your volume).<br/> <br/>Reference: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-workload-demand.html</p>",

      "<p class=\"collapse exam_answer\" id=\"exam_question_1\" style=\"clear: both;\"><strong>Answer: </strong>B<br/> <br/>Explanation:<br/> <br/>Web Identity Federation<br/> <br/>Imagine that you are creating a mobile app that accesses AWS resources, such as a game that runs on a mobile device and stores player and score information using Amazon 53 and DynamoDB.When you write such an app, you’ll make requests to AWS services that must be signed with an AWS access key. However, we strongly recommend that you do not embed or distribute long-term AWScredentials with apps that a user downloads to a device, even in an encrypted store. Instead, build your app so that it requests temporary AWS security credentials dynamically when needed using webidentity federation. The supplied temporary credentials map to an AWS role that has only the permissions needed to perform the tasks required by the mobile app.<br/> <br/>With web identity federation, you don’t need to create custom sign-in code or manage your own user identities. Instead, users of your app can sign in using a well-known identity provider (ldP) – such as Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google, or any other OpenID Connect (OIDC)-compatible ldP, receive an authentication token, and then exchange that token for temporary security credentials in AWS that map to an lAM role with permissions to use the resources in your AWS account. Using an ldP helps you keep your AWS account secure, because you don’t have to embed and distribute longtermsecurity credentials with your application.<br/> <br/>For most scenarios, we recommend that you use Amazon Cognito because it acts as an identity broker and does much of the federation work for you. For details, see the following section, UsingAmazon Cognito for Mobile Apps.<br/> <br/>If you don’t use Amazon Cognito, then you must write code that interacts with a web ldP (Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google, or any other OIDC-compatible ldP) and then calls the Assume RoleWith Web ldentity API to trade the authentication token you get from those ldPs for AWS temporary security credentials. If you have already used this approach for existing apps, you can continue to use it.<br/> <br/>Using Amazon Cognito for Mobile Apps<br/> <br/>The preferred way to use web identity federation is to use Amazon Cognito. For example, Adele the developer is building a game for a mobile device where user data such as scores and profiles is stored in<br/> <br/>Amazon 53 and Amazon DynamoDB. Adele could also store this data locally on the device and use Amazon Cognito to keep it synchronized across devices. She knows that for security and maintenance reasons, long-term AWS security credentials should not be distributed with the game. She also knows that the game might have a large number of users. For all of these reasons, she does not want to create new user identities in lAM for each player. Instead, she builds the game so that users can sign in using an identity that they’ve already established with a well-known identity provider, such as Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google, or any OpenID Connect {OIDC)-compatible identity provider.<br/> <br/>Her game can take advantage of the authentication mechanism from one of these providers to validate the user’s identity.<br/> <br/>To enable the mobile app to access her AWS resources, Adele first registers for a developer 10 with her chosen ldPs. She also configures the application with each of these providers. In her AWSaccount that contains the Amazon 53 bucket and DynamoDB table for the game, Adele uses Amazon Cognito to create lAM roles that precisely define permissions that the game needs. If she is using an OIDC ldP, she also creates an lAM OIDC identity provider entity to establish t rust between her AWS account and the ldP.<br/> <br/>In the app’s code, Adele calls the sign-in interface for the ldP that she configured previously. The ldP handles all the details of letting the user sign in, and the app gets an OAuth access token or OIDC ID token from the provider. Adele’s app can trade this authentication information for a set of temporary security credentials that consist of an AWS access key 10, a secret access key, and a session token.<br/> <br/>The app can then use these credentials to access web services offered by AWS. The app is limited to the permissions that are defined in the role that it assumes.<br/> <br/>The following figure shows a simplified flow for how this might work, using Login with Amazon as the ldP. For Step 2, the app can also use Facebook, Google, or any OIDC-compatible identity provider, but that’s not shown here.<br/> <br/>Sample workflow using Amazon Cognito to federate users for a mobile application </p>",

      "<p>A customer starts your app on a mobile device. The app asks the user to sign in.<br/> <br/>The app uses Login with Amazon resources to accept the user’s credentials.<br/> <br/>The app uses Cognito APIs to exchange the Login with Amazon 10 token for a Cognito token.<br/> <br/>The app requests temporary security credentials from AWS STS, passing the Cognito token.<br/> <br/>The temporary security credentials can be used by the app to access any AWS resources required by the app to operate. The role associated with the temporary security credentials and its assigned policies determines what can be accessed.<br/> <br/>Use the following process to configure your app to use Amazon Cognito to authenticate users and give your app access to AWS resources. For specific steps to accomplish this scenario, consult the documentation for Amazon Cognito.<br/> <br/>(Optional) Sign up as a developer with Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google, or any other OpenID Connect (OIDC}-compatible identity provider and configure one or more apps with the provider. This step is optional because Amazon Cognito also supports unauthenticated (guest) access for your users.<br/> <br/>Go to Amazon Cognito in the AWS Management Console. Use the Amazon Cognito wizard to create an identity pool, which is a container that Amazon Cognito uses to keep end user identities organized for your apps. You can share identity pools between apps. When you set up an identity pool, Amazon Cognito creates one or two lAM roles (one for authenticated identities, and one for unauthenticated \"guest\" identities) that define permissions for Amazon Cognito users.<br/> <br/>Download and integrate the AWS SDK for iOS or the AWS SDK for Android with your app, and import the files required to use Amazon Cognito.<br/> <br/>Create an instance of the Amazon Cognito credentials provider, passing the identity pool ID, your AWS account number, and the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the ro les that you associated with the identity pool. The Amazon Cognito wizard in the AWS Management Console provides sample code to help you get started.<br/> <br/>When your app accesses an AWS resource, pass the credentials provider instance to the client object, which passes temporary security credentials to the client. The permissions for the credentials are based on the role or roles that you defined earlier.</p>",

      "<p class=\"collapse exam_answer\" id=\"exam_question_1\" style=\"clear: both;\"><strong>Answer: </strong>A<br/> <br/>Explanation:<br/> <br/>ElastiCache for Memcached<br/> <br/>The primary goal of caching is typically to offload reads from your database or other primary data source. In most apps, you have hot spots of data that are regularly queried, but only updated periodically. Think of the front page of a blog or news site, or the top 100 leaderboard in an online game. In this type of case, your app can receive dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of requests for the same data before it’s updated again. Having your caching layer handle these queries has several advantages. First, it’s considerably cheaper to add an in-memory cache than to scale up to a largerdatabase cluster. Second, an in-memory cache is also easier to scale out, because it’s easier to distribute an in-memory cache horizontally than a relational database.<br/> <br/>Last, a caching layer provides a request buffer in the event of a sudden spike in usage. If your app or game ends up on the front page of Reddit or the App Store, it’s not unheard of to see a spike that is 10 to 100 times your normal application load. Even if you auto scale your application instances, a lOx request spike will likely make your database very unhappy.<br/> <br/>Let’s focus on ElastiCache for Memcached first, because it is the best fit for a caching focused solution. We’ll revisit Redislater in the paper, and weigh its advantages and disadvantages.<br/> <br/>Architecture with ElastiCache for Memcached<br/> <br/>When you deploy an ElastiCache Memcached cluster, it sits in your application as a separate tier alongside your database. As mentioned previously, Amazon ElastiCache does not directly communicate with your database tier, or indeed have any particular knowledge of your database. A simplified deployment for a web application looks something like this: </p>",
      "<p><img height=\"598\" src=\"https://www.exam4training.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image005.jpg\" v:shapes=\"_x0000_i1026\" width=\"509\"/></p>",
      "<p>In this architecture diagram, the Amazon EC2 application instances are in an Auto Scaling group, located behind a load balancer using Elastic Load Balancing, which distributes requests among the instances. As requests come into a given EC2 instance, that EC2 instance is responsible for communicating with ElastiCache and the database tier. For development purposes, you can begin with a single ElastiCache node to test your application, and then scale to additional cluster nodes by modifying the ElastiCache cluster. As you add additional cache nodes, the EC2 application instances are able to distribute cache keys across multiple ElastiCache nodes. The most common practice is to use client-side sharding to distribute keys across cache nodes, which we will discuss later in this paper. </p>",
      "<p><img height=\"599\" src=\"https://www.exam4training.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image007.jpg\" v:shapes=\"_x0000_i1027\" width=\"519\"/></p>",
      "<p>When you launch an ElastiCache cluster, you can choose the Availability Zone(s) that the cluster lives in. For best performance, you should configure your cluster to use the same Availability Zones asyour application servers. To launch an ElastiCache cluster in a specific Availability Zone, make sure to specify the Preferred Zone(s) option during cache cluster creation. The Availability Zones that youspecify will be where ElastiCache will launch your cache nodes. We recommend that you select Spread Nodes Across Zones, which tells ElastiCache to distribute cache nodes across these zones asevenly as possible. This distribution will mitigate the impact of an Availability Zone disruption on your ElastiCache nodes. The trade-off is that some of the requests from your application to ElastiCache will go to a node in a different Availability Zone, meaning latency will be slightly higher.<br/> <br/>For more details, refer to Creating a Cache Cluster in the Amazon ElastiCache User Guide.<br/> <br/>As mentioned at the outset, ElastiCache can be coupled with a wide variety of databases. Here is an example architecture that uses Amazon DynamoDB instead of Amazon RDS and MySQL: </p>",
      "<p><img height=\"599\" src=\"https://www.exam4training.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image009.jpg\" v:shapes=\"_x0000_i1028\" width=\"519\"/></p>",
      "<p>This combination of DynamoDB and ElastiCache is very popular with mobile and game companies, because DynamoDB allows for higher write throughput at lower cost than traditional relational databases. In addition, DynamoDB uses a key-value access pattern similar to ElastiCache, which also simplifies the programming model. Instead of using relational SQL for the primary database but then key-value patterns for the cache, both the primary database and cache can be programmed similarly.<br/> <br/>In this architecture pattern, DynamoDB remains the source of truth for data, but application reads are offloaded to ElastiCache for a speed boost.</p>",

You store your data in Amazon Glacier as archives. You may upload a single file as an archive, but your costs will be lower if you aggregate your data.<br/> <br/>TAR and ZIP are common formats that customers use to aggregate multiple files into a single file before uploading to Amazon Glacier.<br/> <br/>The total volume of data and number of archives you can store are unlimited. Individual Amazon Glacier archives can range in size from 1 byte to 40 terabytes.<br/> <br/>The largest archive that can be uploaded in a single upload request is 4 gigabytes.<br/> <br/>For items larger than 100 megabytes, customers should consider using the Multipart upload capability.<br/> <br/>Archives stored in Amazon Glacier are immutable, i.e. archives can be uploaded and deleted but cannot be edited or overwritten.<br/> <br/>Reference: https://aws.amazon.com/glacier/faqs/</p>",

      "<p class=\"collapse exam_answer\" id=\"exam_question_1\" style=\"clear: both;\"><strong>Answer: </strong>A<br/> <br/>Explanation:<br/> <br/>Amazon DynamoDB is ideal for database applications that require very low latency and predictable performance at any scale but don’t need complex querying capabilities like joins or transactions. Amazon DynamoDB is a fully-managed NoSQL database service that offers high performance, predictable throughput and low cost. It is easy to set up, operate, and scale.<br/> <br/>With Amazon DynamoDB, you can start small, specify the throughput and storage you need, and easily scale your capacity requirements on the fly. Amazon DynamoDB automatically partitions data over a number of servers to meet your request capacity. In addition, DynamoDB automatically replicates your data synchronously across multiple Availability Zones within an AWS Region to ensure high-availability and data durability.<br/> <br/>Reference: https://aws.amazon.com/running_databases/#dynamodb_anchor</p>",

In other words, you can create, update, or delete a collection of resources by creating, updating, or deleting stacks. All the resources in a stack are defined by the stack’s AWS CloudFormation template. A stack, for instance, can include all the resources required to run a web application, such as a web server, a database, and networking rules. If you no longer require that web application, you can simply delete the stack, and all of its related resources are deleted.<br/> <br/>You are charged for the stack resources for the time they were operating (even if you deleted the stack right away).<br/> <br/>Reference: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacks.html</p>",

The service is targeted at organizations with multiple users or systems that use AWS products such as Amazon EC2, Amazon RDS, and the AWS Management Console. With IAM, you can centrally manage users, security credentials such as access keys, and permissions that control which AWS resources users can access.<br/> <br/>In addition to supporting IAM user policies, some services support resource-based permissions, which let you attach policies to the service’s resources instead of to IAM users or groups.

      "<p class=\"collapse exam_answer\" id=\"exam_question_1\" style=\"clear: both;\"><strong>Answer: </strong>B<br/> <br/>Explanation:<br/> <br/>Amazon VPC enables you to build a virtual network in the AWS cloud – no VPNs, hardware, or physical datacenters required.<br/> <br/>Your AWS resources are automatically provisioned in a ready-to-use default VPC. You can choose to create additional VPCs by going to Amazon VPC page on the AWS Management Console and click on the \"Start VPC Wizard\" button.<br/> <br/>You’ll be presented with four basic options for network architectures. After selecting an option, you can modify the size and IP address range of the VPC and its subnets. If you select an option with Hardware VPN Access, you will need to specify the IP address of the VPN hardware on your network. You can modify the VPC to add more subnets or add or remove gateways at any time after the VPC has been created.<br/> <br/>The four options are:<br/> <br/>VPC with a Single Public Subnet Only<br/> <br/>VPC with Public and Private Subnets<br/> <br/>VPC with Public and Private Subnets and Hardware VPN Access<br/> <br/>VPC with a Private Subnet Only and Hardware VPN Access<br/> <br/>Reference: https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/faqs/</p>",

      "<p class=\"collapse exam_answer\" id=\"exam_question_1\" style=\"clear: both;\"><strong>Answer: </strong>C<br/> <br/>Explanation:<br/> <br/>Amazon Glacier supports various vault operations.<br/> <br/>A vault inventory refers to the list of archives in a vault. For each archive in the list, the inventory provides archive information such as archive ID, creation date, and size. Amazon Glacier updates the vault inventory approximately once a day, starting on the day the first archive is uploaded to the vault. A vault inventory must exist for you to be able to download it.<br/> <br/>Downloading a vault inventory is an asynchronous operation. You must first initiate a job to download the inventory. After receiving the job request, Amazon Glacier prepares your inventory for download. After the job completes, you can download the inventory data.<br/> <br/>Given the asynchronous nature of the job, you can use Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) notifications to notify you when the job completes. You can specify an Amazon SNS topic for each individual job request or configure your vault to send a notification when specific vault events occur.<br/> <br/>Amazon Glacier prepares an inventory for each vault periodically, every 24 hours. If there have been no archive additions or deletions to the vault since the last inventory, the inventory date is not updated. When you initiate a job for a vault inventory, Amazon Glacier returns the last inventory it generated, which is a point-in-time snapshot and not real-time data. You might not find it useful to retrieve vault inventory for each archive upload.<br/> <br/>However, suppose you maintain a database on the client-side associating metadata about the archives you upload to Amazon Glacier. Then, you might find the vault inventory useful to reconcile information in your database with the actual vault inventory.<br/> <br/>Reference: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/working-with-vaults.html</p>",

      "<p class=\"collapse exam_answer\" id=\"exam_question_1\" style=\"clear: both;\"><strong>Answer: </strong>D<br/> <br/>Explanation:<br/> <br/>Reference:<br/> <br/>There are cases where a large number of batch jobs may need processing, and where the jobs may need<br/> <br/>to be re-prioritized.<br/> <br/>For example, one such case is one where there are differences between different levels of services for unpaid users versus subscriber users (such as the time until publication) in services enabling, for example, presentation fi les to be uploaded for publication from a web browser. When the user uploads a presentation file, the conversion processes, for example, for publication are performed as batch processes on the system side, and the file is published after the conversion. Is it then necessary to be able to assign the level of priority to the batch processes for each type of subscriber.<br/> <br/>Explanation of the Cloud Solution/Pattern<br/> <br/>A queue is used in controlling batch jobs. The queue need only be provided with priority numbers.<br/> <br/>Job requests are controlled by the queue, and the job requests in the queue are processed by a batch server. In Cloud computing, a highly reliable queue is provided as a service, which you can use to structure a highly reliable batch system with ease. You may prepare multiple queues depending on priority levels, with job requests put into the queues depending on their priority levels, to apply prioritization to batch processes. The performance (number) of batch servers corresponding to a queue must be in accordance with the priority level thereof.<br/> <br/>Implementation<br/> <br/>In AWS, the queue service is the Simple Queue Service (SQS). Multiple SQS queues may be prepared to prepare queues for individual priority levels (with a priority queue and a secondary queue).<br/> <br/>Moreover, you may also use the message Delayed Send function to delay process execution.<br/> <br/>Use SQS to prepare multiple queues for the individual priority levels.<br/> <br/>Place those processes to be executed immediately (job requests) in the high priority queue.<br/> <br/>Prepare numbers of batch servers, for processing the job requests of the queues, depending on the priority levels.<br/> <br/>Queues have a message \"Delayed Send\" function. You can use this to delay the time for starting a process.<br/> <br/>Configuration </p>",

      "<p>Benefits<br/> <br/>You can increase or decrease the number of servers for processing jobs to change automatically the processing speeds of the priority queues and secondary queues.<br/> <br/>You can handle performance and service requirements through merely increasing or decreasing the number of EC2 instances used in job processing.<br/> <br/>Even if an EC2 were to fail, the messages (jobs) would remain in the queue service, enabling processing to be continued immediately upon recovery of the EC2 instance, producing a system that is robust to failure.<br/> <br/>Cautions<br/> <br/>Depending on the balance between the number of EC2 instances for performing the processes and the number of messages that are queued, there may be cases where processing in the secondary queue may be completed first, so you need to monitor the processing speeds in the primary queue and the secondary queue.</p>",

You have two options depending on how you choose to manage the encryption keys: Server-side encryption and client-side encryption.<br/> <br/>Server-side encryption is about data encryption at rest―that is, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it for you when you access it. As long as you authenticate your request and you have access permissions, there is no difference in the way you access encrypted or unencrypted objects. Amazon S3 manages encryption and decryption for you. For example, if you share your objects using a pre-signed URL, that URL works the same way for both encrypted and unencrypted objects.<br/> <br/>In client-side encryption, you manage encryption/decryption of your data, the encryption keys, and related tools. Server-side encryption is an alternative to client-side encryption in which Amazon S3 manages the encryption of your data, freeing you from the tasks of managing encryption and encryption keys.<br/> <br/>Amazon S3 server-side encryption employs strong multi-factor encryption. Amazon S3 encrypts each object with a unique key. As an additional safeguard, it encrypts the key itself with a master key that it regularly rotates.

      "<p class=\"collapse exam_answer\" id=\"exam_question_1\" style=\"clear: both;\"><strong>Answer: </strong>A<br/> <br/>Explanation:<br/> <br/>Gateway-Cached Volume Architecture<br/> <br/>Gateway-cached volumes let you use Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon 53) as your primary data storage while retaining frequently accessed data locally in your storage gateway. Gatewaycached volumes minimize the need to scale your on-premises storage infrastructure, while still providing your applications with low-latency access to their frequently accessed data. You can createstorage volumes up to 32 TIB in size and attach to them as iSCSI devices from your on-premises application servers. Your gateway stores data that you write to these volumes in Amazon 53 and retains recently read data in your on-premises storage gateway’s cache and upload buffer storage.<br/> <br/>Gateway-cached volumes can range from 1 GIB to 32 TIB in size and must be rounded to the nearest GIB. Each gateway configured for gateway-cached volumes can support up to 32 volumes for a total maximum storage volume of 1,024 TIB (1 Pi B).<br/> <br/>In the gateway-cached volume solution, AWS Storage Gateway stores all your on-premises application data in a storage volume in Amazon 53.<br/> <br/>The following diagram provides an overview of the AWS Storage Gateway-cached volume deployment. </p>",
      "<p><img height=\"348\" src=\"https://www.exam4training.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image027.jpg\" v:shapes=\"_x0000_i1037\" width=\"652\"/></p>",
      "<p>After you’ve installed the AWS Storage Gateway software appliance-the virtual machine (VM)-on a host in your data center and activated it, you can use the AWS Management Console to provision storage volumes backed by Amazon 53. You can also provision storage volumes programmatically using the AWS Storage Gateway API or the AWS SDK libraries. You then mount these storage volumes to your on-premises application servers as iSCSI devices.<br/> <br/>You also al locate disks on-premises for the VM. These on-premises disks serve the following purposes:<br/> <br/>Disks for use by the gateway as cache storage – As your applications write data to the storage volumes in AWS, the gateway initially stores the data on the on-premises disks referred to as cache storage before uploading the data to Amazon 53. The cache storage acts as the on-premises durable store for data that is waiting to upload to Amazon 53 from the upload buffer.<br/> <br/>The cache storage also lets the gateway store your application’s recently accessed data on-premises for low-latency access. If your application requests data, the gateway first checks the cache storage for the data before checking Amazon 53.<br/> <br/>You can use the following guidelines to determine the amount of disk space to allocate for cache storage. Generally, you should allocate at least 20 percent of your existing file store size as cache storage. Cache storage should also be larger than the upload buffer. This latter guideline helps ensure cache storage is large enough to persistently hold all data in the upload buffer that has not yet been uploaded to Amazon 53.<br/> <br/>Disks for use by the gateway as the upload buffer – To prepare for upload to Amazon 53, your gateway also stores incoming data in a staging area, referred to as an upload buffer. Your gateway uploads this buffer data over an encrypted Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connection to AWS, where it is stored encrypted in Amazon 53.<br/> <br/>You can take incremental backups, called snapshots, of your storage volumes in Amazon 53. These point-in-time snapshots are also stored in Amazon 53 as Amazon EBS snapshots. When you take anew snapshot, only the data that has changed since your last snapshot is stored. You can initiate snapshots on a scheduled or one-time basis. When you delete a snapshot, only the data not neededfor any other snapshots is removed.<br/> <br/>You can restore an Amazon EBS snapshot to a gateway storage volume if you need to recover a backup of your data. Alternatively, for snapshots up to 16 TiB in size, you can use the snapshot as astarting point for a new Amazon EBS volume. You can then attach this new Amazon EBS volume to an Amazon EC2 instance.<br/> <br/>All gateway-cached volume data and snapshot data is stored in Amazon 53 encrypted at rest using server-side encryption (SSE).<br/> <br/>However, you cannot access this data with the Amazon 53 API or other tools such as the Amazon 53 console.</p>",

      "<p class=\"collapse exam_answer\" id=\"exam_question_1\" style=\"clear: both;\"><strong>Answer: </strong>A<br/> <br/>Explanation:<br/> <br/>Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring service for AWS cloud resources and the applications you run on AWS. You can use Amazon CloudWatch to collect and track metrics, collect and monitor log files, and set alarms.<br/> <br/>When you create an alarm, you first choose the Amazon CloudWatch metric you want it to monitor. Next, you choose the evaluation period (e.g., five minutes or one hour) and a statistical value to measure (e.g., Average or Maximum).<br/> <br/>To set a threshold, set a target value and choose whether the alarm will trigger when the value is greater than (&gt;), greater than or equal to (&gt;=), less than (&lt;), or less than or equal to (&lt;=) that value.<br/> <br/>Reference: http://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/faqs/</p>",

      "<p class=\"collapse exam_answer\" id=\"exam_question_1\" style=\"clear: both;\"><strong>Answer: </strong>B<br/> <br/>Explanation:<br/> <br/>A virtual private cloud (VPC) is a virtual network dedicated to your AWS account. It is logically isolated from other virtual networks in the AWS cloud. You can launch your AWS resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances, into your VPC. You can configure your VPC: you can select its IP address range, create subnets, and configure route tables, network gateways, and security settings.<br/> <br/>A subnet is a range of IP addresses in your VPC. You can launch AWS resources into a subnet that you select. Use a public subnet for resources that must be connected to the internet, and a private subnet for resources that won’t be connected to the Internet.<br/> <br/>If a subnet’s traffic is routed to an internet gateway, the subnet is known as a public subnet.<br/> <br/>If a subnet doesn’t have a route to the internet gateway, the subnet is known as a private subnet.<br/> <br/>If a subnet doesn’t have a route to the internet gateway, but has its traffic routed to a virtual private gateway, the subnet is known as a VPN-only subnet.<br/> <br/>Reference: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Subnets.html</p>",

      "<p class=\"collapse exam_answer\" id=\"exam_question_1\" style=\"clear: both;\"><strong>Answer: </strong>D<br/> <br/>Explanation:<br/> <br/>Multipart upload in Amazon S3 allows you to upload a single object as a set of parts. Each part is a contiguous portion of the object’s data. You can upload these object parts independently and in any order. If transmission of any part fails, you can re-transmit that part without affecting other parts. After all parts of your object are uploaded, Amazon S3 assembles these parts and creates the object. In general, when your object size reaches 100 MB, you should consider using multipart uploads instead of uploading the<br/> <br/>object in a single operation.<br/> <br/>Using multipart upload provides the following advantages:<br/> <br/>Improved throughput―You can upload parts in parallel to improve throughput.<br/> <br/>Quick recovery from any network issues―Smaller part size minimizes the impact of restarting a failed upload due to a network error.<br/> <br/>Pause and resume object uploads―You can upload object parts over time. Once you initiate a multipart upload there is no expiry; you must explicitly complete or abort the multipart upload.<br/> <br/>Begin an upload before you know the final object size―You can upload an object as you are creating it.<br/> <br/>Reference: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/uploadobjusingmpu.html</p>",

AWS specifies that the default Availability Zone should be accepted. This is because it enables AWS to select the best Availability Zone based on the system health and available capacity. If the user launches additional instances, only then an Availability Zone should be specified.

      "<p class=\"collapse exam_answer\" id=\"exam_question_1\" style=\"clear: both;\"><strong>Answer: </strong>A<br/> <br/>Explanation:<br/> <br/>Amazon RDS supports DB instances running several versions of PostgreSQL. Currently we support PostgreSQL versions 9.3.1, 9.3.2, and 9.3.3. You can create DB instances and DB snapshots, point-in-time restores and backups.<br/> <br/>DB instances running PostgreSQL support Multi-AZ deployments, Provisioned IOPS, and can be created inside a VPC. You can also use SSL to connect to a DB instance running PostgreSQL.<br/> <br/>You can use any standard SQL client application to run commands for the instance from your client computer. Such applications include pgAdmin, a popular Open Source administration and development tool for PostgreSQL, or psql, a command line utility that is part of a PostgreSQL installation. In order to deliver a managed service experience, Amazon RDS does not provide host access to DB instances, and it restricts access to certain system procedures and tables that require advanced privileges. Amazon RDS supports access to databases on a DB instance using any standard SQL client application. Amazon RDS does not allow direct host access to a DB instance via Telnet or Secure Shell (SSH).<br/> <br/>Reference: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_PostgreSQL.html</p>",
