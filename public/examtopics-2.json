You only pay for the services you consume, and once you stop using them, there are no additional costs or termination fees.Reference:https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/\n                                    "}, {"name": "Exam AWS Certified Data Analytics - Specialty topic 1 question 39 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/28681-exam-aws-certified-data-analytics-specialty-topic-1-question/", "reply": "26", "views": "2122", "username": "Priyanka_01", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            jueueuergen\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 3Â days, 6Â hours ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-data-analytics-specialty/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Data Analytics - Specialty\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 39<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-data-analytics-specialty/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Data Analytics - Specialty Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"673584\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">A media company has been performing analytics on log data generated by its applications.

When a user requests content that you're serving with<br/>CloudFront, the user is routed to the edge location that provides the lowest latency (time delay), so that content is delivered with the best possible performance.<br/>Routing traffic to an Amazon CloudFront web distribution by using your domain name.<br/>If you want to speed up delivery of your web content, you can use Amazon CloudFront, the AWS content delivery network (CDN). CloudFront can deliver your entire website ג€\" including dynamic, static, streaming, and interactive content ג€\" by using a global network of edge locations. Requests for your content are automatically routed to the edge location that gives your users the lowest latency.<br/>To use CloudFront to distribute your content, you create a web distribution and specify settings such as the Amazon S3 bucket or HTTP server that you want<br/>CloudFront to get your content from, whether you want only selected users to have access to your content, and whether you want to require users to use HTTPS.<br/>When you create a web distribution, CloudFront assigns a domain name to the distribution, such asd111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net. You can use this domain name in the URLs for your content, for example:<br/>[1]<br/>Alternatively, you might prefer to use your own domain name in URLs, for example:<br/>[1]<br/>If you want to use your own domain name, use Amazon Route 53 to create an alias record that points to your CloudFront distribution. An alias record is a Route<br/>53 extension to DNS. It's similar to a CNAME record, but you can create an alias record both for the root domain, such as example.com, and for subdomains, such aswww.example.com. (You can create CNAME records only for subdomains.) When Route 53 receives a DNS query that matches the name and type of an alias record, Route 53 responds with the domain name that is associated with your distribution.<br/>Reference:<br/>https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-to-cloudfront-distribution.html https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Introduction.html\n                                    </span>\n</p>\n</div>\n<!-- / Question  -->\n<div class=\"discussion-meta-data mt-3 pt-1 border-top\">\n                                    by\n                                    \n                                    <a class=\"title-username\" href=\"/user/DK2/\" style=\"\">\n<i class=\"fa fa-user-o\"></i>\n                                        DK2\n                                    </a>\n                                    \n                                    at <i>\n                                    June 4, 2020, 2:28 a.m.</i>\n</div>\n</div>", "que": ["A companyג€™s website runs on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB).

When a user requests content that you're serving withCloudFront, the user is routed to the edge location that provides the lowest latency (time delay), so that content is delivered with the best possible performance.Routing traffic to an Amazon CloudFront web distribution by using your domain name.If you want to speed up delivery of your web content, you can use Amazon CloudFront, the AWS content delivery network (CDN). CloudFront can deliver your entire website ג€\" including dynamic, static, streaming, and interactive content ג€\" by using a global network of edge locations. Requests for your content are automatically routed to the edge location that gives your users the lowest latency.To use CloudFront to distribute your content, you create a web distribution and specify settings such as the Amazon S3 bucket or HTTP server that you wantCloudFront to get your content from, whether you want only selected users to have access to your content, and whether you want to require users to use HTTPS.When you create a web distribution, CloudFront assigns a domain name to the distribution, such asd111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net. You can use this domain name in the URLs for your content, for example:[1]Alternatively, you might prefer to use your own domain name in URLs, for example:[1]If you want to use your own domain name, use Amazon Route 53 to create an alias record that points to your CloudFront distribution. An alias record is a Route53 extension to DNS.

For more information about replication with Amazon Aurora, see the online documentation.Reference:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_ReadRepl.html https://aws.amazon.com/rds/features/read-replicas/\n                                    "}, {"name": "Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate SAA-C02 topic 1 question 8 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/21997-exam-aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02/", "reply": "125", "views": "24177", "username": "DK2", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            nickname20212021\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 3Â days, 14Â hours ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate SAA-C02\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 8<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate SAA-C02 Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"690448\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">A company runs a multi-tier web application that hosts news content.

You can connect to your instance and customize it. When the instance is configured correctly, ensure data integrity by stopping the instance before you create an AMI, then create the image. When you create an Amazon EBS-backed<br/>AMI, we automatically register it for you.<br/>Amazon EC2 powers down the instance before creating the AMI to ensure that everything on the instance is stopped and in a consistent state during the creation process. If you're confident that your instance is in a consistent state appropriate for AMI creation, you can tell Amazon EC2 not to power down and reboot the instance. Some file systems, such as XFS, can freeze and unfreeze activity, making it safe to create the image without rebooting the instance.<br/>During the AMI-creation process, Amazon EC2 creates snapshots of your instance's root volume and any other EBS volumes attached to your instance. If any volumes attached to the instance are encrypted, the new AMI only launches successfully on instances that support Amazon EBS encryption. For more information, see<br/><br/>Amazon EBS Encryption -<br/>.<br/>Depending on the size of the volumes, it can take several minutes for the AMI-creation process to complete (sometimes up to 24 hours). You may find it more efficient to create snapshots of your volumes prior to creating your AMI. This way, only small, incremental snapshots need to be created when the AMI is created, and the process completes more quickly (the total time for snapshot creation remains the same).

You can connect to your instance and customize it. When the instance is configured correctly, ensure data integrity by stopping the instance before you create an AMI, then create the image. When you create an Amazon EBS-backedAMI, we automatically register it for you.Amazon EC2 powers down the instance before creating the AMI to ensure that everything on the instance is stopped and in a consistent state during the creation process. If you're confident that your instance is in a consistent state appropriate for AMI creation, you can tell Amazon EC2 not to power down and reboot the instance. Some file systems, such as XFS, can freeze and unfreeze activity, making it safe to create the image without rebooting the instance.During the AMI-creation process, Amazon EC2 creates snapshots of your instance's root volume and any other EBS volumes attached to your instance.

Apply network ACLs and allow traffic from the local VPC and peered VPCs only. Within the task definition in Amazon ECS for each of the microservices, specify a log configuration by using the awslogs driver.

If there is any denied network traffic for a service, the Security team must be notified of any denied requests, including the source IP.How can connectivity be established between service while meeting the security requirements?", "Suggested Answer:\nC"], "que_header": "<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 407<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>", "ans": "Suggested Answer:\nC ", "ans_details": "\n"}, {"name": "Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional topic 1 question 403 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/5776-exam-aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional-topic-1/", "reply": "42", "views": "4699", "username": "Vin", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            DashL\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 4Â days, 16Â hours ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 403<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"675106\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">[1]<br/>[1]<br/>are accessed frequently for the first 15 to 20 days, they are seldom accessed thereafter but always need to be immediately available.

If the IAM user has read/write permissions for Amazon CloudWatch but not for Amazon EC2, he can still create an alarm.However, the stop or terminate actions will not be performed on the Amazon EC2 instance.Reference:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/UsingAlarmActions.html\n                                    "}, {"name": "Exam ANS-C00 topic 1 question 344

If the terminated instance was the active node, the function promotes the standby to master and points the Route 53 record to it.\n                                                </li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<a class=\"btn btn-primary reveal-solution\" href=\"#\">Show Suggested Answer</a>\n<a class=\"btn btn-primary hide-solution d-none\" href=\"#\">Hide Answer</a>\n<p class=\"card-text question-answer bg-light white-text\">\n<span class=\"correct-answer-box\"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong>\n<span class=\"correct-answer\">D</span> <br/></span>\n<span class=\"answer-description\">\n</span>\n</p>\n</div>\n<!-- / Question  -->\n<div class=\"discussion-meta-data mt-3 pt-1 border-top\">\n                                    by\n                                    \n                                    <a class=\"title-username\" href=\"/user/BeastX/\" style=\"\">\n<i class=\"fa fa-user-o\"></i>\n                                        BeastX\n                                    </a>\n                                    \n                                    at <i>\n                                    Nov. 18, 2019, 3 a.m.</i>\n</div>\n</div>", "que": ["A company runs a database on a single Amazon EC2 instance in a development environment.

The company has been running a pilot deployment of around 100 sensors for 3 months each sensor uploads 1KB of sensor data every minute to a backend hosted on AWS.<br/>During the pilot, you measured a peak or 10 IOPS on the database, and you stored an average of 3GB of sensor data per month in the database.<br/>The current deployment consists of a load-balanced auto scaled Ingestion layer using EC2 instances and a PostgreSQL RDS database with 500GB standard storage.<br/>The pilot is considered a success and your CEO has managed to get the attention or some potential investors. The business plan requires a deployment of at least 100K sensors which needs to be supported by the backend.

Because the deployment is high-risk, you need to roll the new version out to users over a number of hours, to make sure everything is working correctly. You need to be able to control the proportion of users seeing the new version of the application down to the percentage point. You use ELB and EC2 with Auto Scaling Groups and custom AMIs with your code pre-installed assigned to Launch Configurations. There are no database-level changes during your deployment. You have been told you cannot spend too much money, so you must not increase the number of EC2 instances much at all during the deployment, but you also need to be able to switch back to the original version of code quickly if something goes wrong.<br/>What is the best way to meet these requirements?<br/></p>\n<div class=\"question-choices-container\">\n<ul>\n<li class=\"multi-choice-item correct-hidden\">\n<span class=\"multi-choice-letter\">\n                                                        A.\n                                                    </span>\n                                                    \n                                                    Create a second ELB, Auto Scaling Launch Configuration, and Auto Scaling Group using the Launch Configuration.
