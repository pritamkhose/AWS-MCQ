When we decide whether to allow traffic to reach an instance, we evaluate all the rules from all the security groups that are associated with the instance.Reference:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-network-security.html\n                                    "}, {"name": "Exam AWS-SysOps topic 1 question 359 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/17405-exam-aws-sysops-topic-1-question-359-discussion/", "reply": "1", "views": "197", "username": "awscertified", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            awscertified\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 1Â year, 3Â months ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-sysops/\">\n                                    AWS-SysOps\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 359<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-sysops/\">\n                                    [All AWS-SysOps Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"704861\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">Which of the following size ranges is true of Individual Amazon S3 objects?<br/></p>\n<div class=\"question-choices-container\">\n<ul>\n<li class=\"multi-choice-item\">\n<span class=\"multi-choice-letter\">\n                                                        A.\n                                                    </span>\n                                                    \n                                                    5 gigabytes to 5 terabytes\n                                                </li>\n<li class=\"multi-choice-item correct-hidden\">\n<span class=\"multi-choice-letter\">\n                                                        B.\n                                                    </span>\n                                                    \n                                                    0 bytes to 5 terabytes\n                                                </li>\n<li class=\"multi-choice-item\">\n<span class=\"multi-choice-letter\">\n                                                        C.\n                                                    </span>\n                                                    \n                                                    100 megabytes to 5 gigabytes\n                                                </li>\n<li class=\"multi-choice-item\">\n<span class=\"multi-choice-letter\">\n                                                        D.\n                                                    </span>\n                                                    \n                                                    1 byte to 5 gigabytes\n                                                </li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<a class=\"btn btn-primary reveal-solution\" href=\"#\">Show Suggested Answer</a>\n<a class=\"btn btn-primary hide-solution d-none\" href=\"#\">Hide Answer</a>\n<p class=\"card-text question-answer bg-light white-text\">\n<span class=\"correct-answer-box\"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong>\n<span class=\"correct-answer\">B</span> <br/></span>\n<span class=\"answer-description\">\n                                        The total volume of data and number of objects you can store are unlimited.

AmazonSQS requires no pre-provisioning.Scaling transparently -your buffer requests and the load changes as a result of occasional load spikes or the natural growth of your business. Because AmazonSQS can process each buffered request independently, Amazon SQS can scale transparently to handle the load without any provisioning instructions from you.Reference:http://aws.amazon.com/sqs/\n                                    "}, {"name": "Exam AWS-SysOps topic 1 question 344 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/17391-exam-aws-sysops-topic-1-question-344-discussion/", "reply": "1", "views": "317", "username": "awscertified", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            awscertified\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 1Â year, 3Â months ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-sysops/\">\n                                    AWS-SysOps\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 344<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-sysops/\">\n                                    [All AWS-SysOps Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"406398\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">A block device is a storage device that moves data in sequences.

Processing latency must be kept low. Based on calculations, a 60-shard Amazon Kinesis stream is more than sufficient to handle the maximum data throughput, even with traffic spikes.
