The threat was documented as follows:<br/>Threat description: A malicious actor could upload sensitive data from Server X by configuring credentials for an AWS account (Account 2) they control and uploading data to an Amazon S3 bucket within their control.<br/>Server X has outbound internet access configured via a proxy server.

Generally, if the user uses the instances around 30-40% of the year annually it is recommended to use RI. Here as the instance runs only for 1 hour 50 minutes daily, or less than 8 percent of the year, it is not recommended to have RI as it will be costlier. At its highest potential savings, you are still paying 25 percent of an annual cost for a reserved instance you are you using less than 2 hours a day, (or less than 8 percent of each year) you are not saving money. Even a scheduled reserved instance has a key limitation, which is that it cannot be stopped or rebooted, only manually terminated with a possibility that it could be restarted. You would have to terminate and restart it within the 1 hour 50-minute window, otherwise you would need to wait until the next day. For a critical daily process, this is likely not an option. Spot Instances are not ideal because the process is critical, and must run for a fixed length of time at a fixed time of day. Spot instances would stop and start based on fluctuations in instance pricing, leaving this process potentially unfinished. The user should use on-demand with EBS in this case. While it has the highest cost, it also has the greatest flexibility to ensure that a critical process like this is always completed.<br/>Reference:<br/>http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/purchasing-options/reserved-instances/\n                                    </span>\n</p>\n</div>\n<!-- / Question  -->\n<div class=\"discussion-meta-data mt-3 pt-1 border-top\">\n                                    by\n                                    \n                                    <a class=\"title-username\" href=\"/user/KatiePerry/\" style=\"\">\n<i class=\"fa fa-user-o\"></i>\n                                        KatiePerry\n                                    </a>\n                                    \n                                    at <i>\n                                    Jan. 6, 2020, 4:44 p.m.</i>\n</div>\n</div>", "que": ["A user is running a critical batch process which runs for 1 hour and 50 mins every day at a fixed time.

Generally, if the user uses the instances around 30-40% of the year annually it is recommended to use RI. Here as the instance runs only for 1 hour 50 minutes daily, or less than 8 percent of the year, it is not recommended to have RI as it will be costlier. At its highest potential savings, you are still paying 25 percent of an annual cost for a reserved instance you are you using less than 2 hours a day, (or less than 8 percent of each year) you are not saving money. Even a scheduled reserved instance has a key limitation, which is that it cannot be stopped or rebooted, only manually terminated with a possibility that it could be restarted. You would have to terminate and restart it within the 1 hour 50-minute window, otherwise you would need to wait until the next day. For a critical daily process, this is likely not an option.

However, the access policy language requires you to specify the resource or resources using the following Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format. arn:aws:service:region:account:resource<br/>Where:<br/>service identifies the AWS product.

In addition, all backups are automatically encrypted, cataloged, easily discoverable, and retained until explicitly deleted.\n                                    "}, {"name": "Exam AWS Certified Database - Specialty topic 1 question 139 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/48844-exam-aws-certified-database-specialty-topic-1-question-139/", "reply": "6", "views": "168", "username": "novak18", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            Aesthet\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 1Â month, 1Â week ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-database-specialty/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Database - Specialty\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 139<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-database-specialty/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Database - Specialty Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"657298\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">A company is using an Amazon RDS for MySQL DB instance for its internal applications.

To identify re-sources by their tags, you can use the DescribeTags action to list all of your tags and their associated resources.Reference:http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.html\n                                    "}, {"name": "Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional topic 1 question 71 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/52807-exam-aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional-topic-1/", "reply": "2", "views": "115", "username": "alfa2", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            01037\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 1Â month, 2Â weeks ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 71<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"674774\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">You have deployed a three-tier web application in a VPC with a CIDR block of 10.0.0.0/28.
