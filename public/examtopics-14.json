The object owner can update the ACL either during a put or copy operation, or after the object is added to the bucket.Similar:https://aws.amazon.com/it/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/s3-require-object-ownership/Resolution Add a bucket policy that grants users access to put objects in your bucket only when they grant you (the bucket owner) full control of the object.Reference:https://aws.amazon.com/it/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/s3-bucket-owner-access/\n                                    "}, {"name": "Exam AWS DevOps Engineer Professional topic 1 question 223 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/47894-exam-aws-devops-engineer-professional-topic-1-question-223/", "reply": "2", "views": "258", "username": "1234567J", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            WhyIronMan\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 3Â months, 1Â week ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-devops-engineer-professional/\">\n                                    AWS DevOps Engineer Professional\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 223<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-devops-engineer-professional/\">\n                                    [All AWS DevOps Engineer Professional Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"675676\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">The development team is creating a social media game which ranks users on a scoreboard.

The evaluation logic follows these rules:<br/>By default, all requests are denied.

This value distinguishes it from other versions of the same key.Reference:https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=wv45DQAAQBAJ&pg=PA39&lpg=PA39&dq=hosts+a+static+website+within+an+Amazon+S3+bucket.+A+solutions+architect+needs+to+ensure+that+data+can+be+recovered+in+case+of+accidental+deletion&source=bl&ots=0NolP5igY5&sig=ACfU3U3opL9Jha6jM2EI8x7EcjK4rigQHQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiS9e3yy7vpAhVx73MBHZNoDnQQ6AEwAH oECBQQAQ#v=onepage&q=hosts%20a%20static%20website%20within%20an%20Amazon%20S3%20bucket.%20A%20solutions%20architect%20needs%20to%20ensure%20that%20data%20can%20be%20recovered%20in%20case%20of%20accidental%20deletion&f=false https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/securing-access-to-aws-using-mfa-part-3/ https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ObjectVersioning.html\n                                    "}, {"name": "Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate SAA-C02 topic 1 question 43 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/22048-exam-aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02/", "reply": "32", "views": "10834", "username": "DK2", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            sagacious_smith\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 3Â months, 1Â week ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate SAA-C02\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 43<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate SAA-C02 Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"690483\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">A solutions architect is designing storage for a high performance computing (HPC) environment based on Amazon Linux.

Amazon FSx for Lustre provides a high-performance file system optimized for fast processing of workloads such as machine learning, high performance computing (HPC), video processing, financial modeling, and electronic design automation (EDA).<br/>FSx for Lustre allows customers to create a Lustre filesystem on demand and associate it to an Amazon S3 bucket. As part of the filesystem creation, Lustre reads the objects in the buckets and adds that to the file system metadata. Any Lustre client in your VPC is then able to access the data, which gets cached on the high- speed Lustre filesystem. This is ideal for HPC workloads, because you can get the speed of an optimized Lustre file system without having to manage the complexity of deploying, optimizing, and managing the Lustre cluster.<br/>Additionally, having the filesystem work natively with Amazon S3 means you can shut down the Lustre filesystem when you donג€™t need it but still access objects in<br/>Amazon S3 via other AWS Services. FSx for Lustre also allows you to also write the output of your HPC job back to Amazon S3.<br/>Reference:<br/>https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/AWS%20Partner%20Network_HPC%20Storage%20Options_2019_FINAL.pdf<br/>(p.8)\n                                    </span>\n</p>\n</div>\n<!-- / Question  -->\n<div class=\"discussion-meta-data mt-3 pt-1 border-top\">\n                                    by\n                                    \n                                    <a class=\"title-username\" href=\"/user/DK2/\" style=\"\">\n<i class=\"fa fa-user-o\"></i>\n                                        DK2\n                                    </a>\n                                    \n                                    at <i>\n                                    June 4, 2020, 3:05 a.m.</i>\n</div>\n</div>", "que": ["A solutions architect is designing storage for a high performance computing (HPC) environment based on Amazon Linux.

Additionally, the browsing metadata must be written and read with very low latency to ensure a good viewing experience for the users.Which database solution meets these requirements?", "Suggested Answer:\nC \n\n                                        Reference:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/GlobalTables.html"], "que_header": "<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-database-specialty/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Database - Specialty\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 31<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-database-specialty/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Database - Specialty Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>", "ans": "Suggested Answer:\nC ", "ans_details": "\n                                        Reference:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/GlobalTables.html\n                                    "}, {"name": "Exam AWS Certified Database - Specialty topic 1 question 30 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/26016-exam-aws-certified-database-specialty-topic-1-question-30/", "reply": "8", "views": "1122", "username": "learnaws", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            LMax\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 3Â months, 2Â weeks ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-database-specialty/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Database - Specialty\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 30<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-database-specialty/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Database - Specialty Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"657189\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">A company is planning to close for several days.

The companyג€™s backend systems sit in the private subnet of an<br/>Amazon VPC. The company uses a NAT gateway to allow these systems to communicate with external vendors over IPv4. Company policy requires systems that communicate with external vendors to use a security group that limits access to only approved external vendors. The virtual private cloud (VPC) uses the default network ACL.<br/>The Systems Operator successfully assigns IPv6 addresses to each of the backend systems.

Only your cluster members in one region must be able to connect to each other.

AWS Config simply alerts you that there is a violation and it's up to you to take the appropriate action.Reference:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/evaluate-config_view-compliance.html\n                                    "}, {"name": "Exam AWS-SysOps topic 2 question 152 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/26245-exam-aws-sysops-topic-2-question-152-discussion/", "reply": "5", "views": "994", "username": "SHoKMaSTeR", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            lemist\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 3Â months, 3Â weeks ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-sysops/\">\n                                    AWS-SysOps\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 152<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 2\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-sysops/\">\n                                    [All AWS-SysOps Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"494056\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">A SysOps Administrator is building a process for sharing Amazon RDS database snapshots between different accounts associated with different business units with the same company.

The company uses Ohio (us-east-2) as the primary Region and Northern Virginia (us- east-1) as the Disaster Recovery (DR) Region. The data is continuously replicated from the primary Region to the DR Region by a single instance on the public subnet in both Regions.

The application has scaled well, however, costs have increased exponentially because of higher than anticipated Lambda costs.
