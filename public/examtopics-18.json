For more information, seeVolume Discounts.✑ No extra fee ג€\" Consolidated billing is offered at no additional cost.\n                                    "}, {"name": "Exam AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner topic 1 question 78 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/8862-exam-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-topic-1-question-78/", "reply": "4", "views": "6243", "username": "Dream", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            Jerecax\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 8Â months, 2Â weeks ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 78<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"703909\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">When performing a cost analysis that supports physical isolation of a customer workload, which compute hosting model should be accounted for in the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)?<br/></p>\n<div class=\"question-choices-container\">\n<ul>\n<li class=\"multi-choice-item correct-hidden\">\n<span class=\"multi-choice-letter\">\n                                                        A.\n                                                    </span>\n                                                    \n                                                    Dedicated Hosts\n                                                </li>\n<li class=\"multi-choice-item\">\n<span class=\"multi-choice-letter\">\n                                                        B.\n                                                    </span>\n                                                    \n                                                    Reserved Instances\n                                                </li>\n<li class=\"multi-choice-item\">\n<span class=\"multi-choice-letter\">\n                                                        C.\n                                                    </span>\n                                                    \n                                                    On-Demand Instances\n                                                </li>\n<li class=\"multi-choice-item\">\n<span class=\"multi-choice-letter\">\n                                                        D.\n                                                    </span>\n                                                    \n                                                    No Upfront Reserved Instances\n                                                </li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<a class=\"btn btn-primary reveal-solution\" href=\"#\">Show Suggested Answer</a>\n<a class=\"btn btn-primary hide-solution d-none\" href=\"#\">Hide Answer</a>\n<p class=\"card-text question-answer bg-light white-text\">\n<span class=\"correct-answer-box\"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong>\n<span class=\"correct-answer\">A</span> <br/></span>\n<span class=\"answer-description\">\n                                        Use Dedicated Hosts to launch Amazon EC2 instances on physical servers that are dedicated for your use.

This can simplify the execution of the DR plan.Reference:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/resources.html\n                                    "}, {"name": "Exam AWS Certified Machine Learning - Specialty topic 1 question 63 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/10089-exam-aws-certified-machine-learning-specialty-topic-1/", "reply": "6", "views": "2149", "username": "rsimham", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            syu31svc\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 10Â months ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-machine-learning-specialty/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Machine Learning - Specialty\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 63<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-machine-learning-specialty/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Machine Learning - Specialty Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"632973\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">A retail company intends to use machine learning to categorize new products.

If the user has created a public private subnet to host the web server and DB server respectively, the user should configure that the instances in the private subnet can connect to the internet using the NAT instances.

TheVPC has an implied router and the VPC wizard updates the main route table used with the private subnet, creates a custom route table and associates it with the public subnet.\n                                    "}, {"name": "Exam AWS Certified Big Data - Specialty topic 2 question 17 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/4082-exam-aws-certified-big-data-specialty-topic-2-question-17/", "reply": "6", "views": "1663", "username": "mattyb123", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            Venky_2020\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 11Â months, 2Â weeks ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-big-data-specialty/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Big Data - Specialty\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 17<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 2\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-big-data-specialty/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Big Data - Specialty Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"451910\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">A gas company needs to monitor gas pressure in their pipelines.

AWS S3 provides lifecycle rules to archive and restore objects from S3 to Glacier. Once the object is archived their storage class will change to Glacier. If the user sends a request for restore, the storage class will still be Glacier for the restored object. The user will be paying for both the archived copy as well as for the restored object. The object is available only for the duration specified in the restore request and if the user wants to modify that period, he has to raise another restore request with the updated duration.\n                                    </span>\n</p>\n</div>\n<!-- / Question  -->\n<div class=\"discussion-meta-data mt-3 pt-1 border-top\">\n                                    by\n                                    \n                                    <a class=\"title-username\" href=\"/user/karmaah/\" style=\"\">\n<i class=\"fa fa-user-o\"></i>\n                                        karmaah\n                                    </a>\n                                    \n                                    at <i>\n                                    Dec. 26, 2019, 2:43 p.m.</i>\n</div>\n</div>", "que": ["A user has moved an object to Glacier using the life cycle rules.

For example, you might not want users to have direct access to your stack's app servers or databases and instead require that all public traffic be channeled through an Elastic Load Balancer. A VPC consists of one or more subnets, each of which contains one or more instances. Each subnet has an associated routing table that directs outbound traffic based on its destination IP address. Instances within a VPC can generally communicate with each other, regardless of their subnet. Subnets whose instances can communicate with the<br/>Internet are referred to as public subnets. Subnets whose instances can communicate only with other instances in the VPC and cannot communicate directly with the Internet are referred to as private subnets.<br/>AWS OpsWorks requires the VPC to be configured so that every instance in the stack, including instances in private subnets, has access to the following endpoints:<br/>The AWS OpsWorks service,<br/>https://opsworks-instance-service.us-east-1.amazonaws.com<br/>.

Subnets whose instances can communicate only with other instances in the VPC and cannot communicate directly with the Internet are referred to as private subnets.AWS OpsWorks requires the VPC to be configured so that every instance in the stack, including instances in private subnets, has access to the following endpoints:The AWS OpsWorks service,https://opsworks-instance-service.us-east-1.amazonaws.com.

For example, you might not want users to have direct access to your stack's app servers or databases and instead require that all public traffic be channeled through an Elastic Load Balancer.

For example, you can override the instance type using AWS CLI commands.Reference:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/latest/userguide/create-lc-with-instanceID.html\n                                    "}, {"name": "Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional topic 1 question 352 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/15935-exam-aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional-topic-1/", "reply": "2", "views": "538", "username": "NNHAN", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            Mkumar\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 1Â year, 1Â month ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 352<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"406009\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">Someone is creating a VPC for their application hosting.
