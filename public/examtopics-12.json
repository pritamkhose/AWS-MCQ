For more information on Multi-AZ deployments, seeHigh Availability (Multi-AZ).\n                                    "}, {"name": "Exam AWS Certified Developer Associate topic 1 question 156 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/51369-exam-aws-certified-developer-associate-topic-1-question-156/", "reply": "1", "views": "11", "username": "rajatindia", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            rajatindia\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 2Â months ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-developer-associate/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Developer Associate\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 156<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-developer-associate/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Developer Associate Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"452134\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">A company uses Amazon DynamoDB for managing and tracking orders.

When you provision a Multi-AZ DB Instance, Amazon RDS automatically creates a primary DB Instance and synchronously replicates the data to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone (AZ). Each AZ runs on its own physically distinct, independent infrastructure, and is engineered to be highly reliable. In case of an infrastructure failure (for example, instance hardware failure, storage failure, or network disruption), Amazon RDS performs an automatic failover to the standby, so that you can resume database operations as soon as the failover is complete. Since the endpoint for your DB Instance remains the same after a failover, your application can resume database operation without the need for manual administrative intervention.<br/><br/>Enhanced Durability -<br/><br/>Multi-AZ deployments for the -<br/>,<br/><br/>Oracle -<br/>, and<br/><br/>PostgreSQL -<br/>engines utilize synchronous physical replication to keep data on the standby up-to-date with the primary. Multi-AZ deployments for the<br/><br/>SQL Server -<br/>engine use synchronous logical replication to achieve the same result, employing SQL Server-native Mirroring technology. Both approaches safeguard your data in the event of a DB Instance failure or loss of an Availability Zone.<br/>If a storage volume on your primary fails in a Multi-AZ deployment, Amazon RDS automatically initiates a failover to the up-to-date standby. Compare this to a<br/>Single-AZ deployment: in case of a Single-AZ database failure, a user-initiated point-in-time-restore operation will be required. This operation can take several hours to complete, and any data updates that occurred after the latest restorable time (typically within the last five minutes) will not be available.<br/><br/>Amazon Aurora -<br/>employs a highly durable, SSD-backed virtualized storage layer purpose-built for database workloads. Amazon Aurora automatically replicates your volume six ways, across three Availability Zones. Amazon Aurora storage is fault-tolerant, transparently handling the loss of up to two copies of data without affecting database write availability and up to three copies without affecting read availability. Amazon Aurora storage is also self-healing. Data blocks and disks are continuously scanned for errors and replaced automatically.<br/><br/>Increased Availability -<br/>You also benefit from enhanced database availability when running Multi-AZ deployments. If an Availability Zone failure or DB Instance failure occurs, your availability impact is limited to the time automatic failover takes to complete: typically under one minute for Amazon Aurora and one to two minutes for other database engines (see the<br/><br/>RDS FAQ -<br/>for details).<br/>The availability benefits of Multi-AZ deployments also extend to planned maintenance and backups. In the case of system upgrades like OS patching or DB<br/>Instance scaling, these operations are applied first on the standby, prior to the automatic failover. As a result, your availability impact is, again, only the time required for automatic failover to complete.<br/>Unlike Single-AZ deployments, I/O activity is not suspended on your primary during backup for Multi-AZ deployments for the MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL engines, because the backup is taken from the standby. However, note that you may still experience elevated latencies for a few minutes during backups for Multi-<br/>AZ deployments.<br/>On instance failure in Amazon Aurora deployments, Amazon RDS uses RDS Multi-AZ technology to automate failover to one of up to 15 Amazon Aurora Replicas you have created in any of three Availability Zones. If no Amazon Aurora Replicas have been provisioned, in the case of a failure, Amazon RDS will attempt to create a new Amazon Aurora DB instance for you automatically.\n                                    </span>\n</p>\n</div>\n<!-- / Question  -->\n<div class=\"discussion-meta-data mt-3 pt-1 border-top\">\n                                    by\n                                    \n                                    <a class=\"title-username\" href=\"/user/BillyC/\" style=\"\">\n<i class=\"fa fa-user-o\"></i>\n                                        BillyC\n                                    </a>\n                                    \n                                    at <i>\n                                    Feb. 12, 2020, 8:10 p.m.</i>\n</div>\n</div>", "que": ["Your company runs a customer facing event registration site This site is built with a 3-tier architecture with web and application tier servers and a MySQL database The application requires 6 web tier servers and 6 application tier servers for normal operation, but can run on a minimum of 65% server capacity and a single MySQL database.When deploying this application in a region with three availability zones (AZs) which architecture provides high availability?", "Suggested Answer:\nMySQLD \n\n                                        Amazon RDS Multi-AZ Deployments -Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployments provide enhanced availability and durability for Database (DB) Instances, making them a natural fit for production database workloads.

When you provision a Multi-AZ DB Instance, Amazon RDS automatically creates a primary DB Instance and synchronously replicates the data to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone (AZ). Each AZ runs on its own physically distinct, independent infrastructure, and is engineered to be highly reliable. In case of an infrastructure failure (for example, instance hardware failure, storage failure, or network disruption), Amazon RDS performs an automatic failover to the standby, so that you can resume database operations as soon as the failover is complete. Since the endpoint for your DB Instance remains the same after a failover, your application can resume database operation without the need for manual administrative intervention.Enhanced Durability -Multi-AZ deployments for the -,Oracle -, andPostgreSQL -engines utilize synchronous physical replication to keep data on the standby up-to-date with the primary. Multi-AZ deployments for theSQL Server -engine use synchronous logical replication to achieve the same result, employing SQL Server-native Mirroring technology. Both approaches safeguard your data in the event of a DB Instance failure or loss of an Availability Zone.If a storage volume on your primary fails in a Multi-AZ deployment, Amazon RDS automatically initiates a failover to the up-to-date standby. Compare this to aSingle-AZ deployment: in case of a Single-AZ database failure, a user-initiated point-in-time-restore operation will be required. This operation can take several hours to complete, and any data updates that occurred after the latest restorable time (typically within the last five minutes) will not be available.Amazon Aurora -employs a highly durable, SSD-backed virtualized storage layer purpose-built for database workloads. Amazon Aurora automatically replicates your volume six ways, across three Availability Zones. Amazon Aurora storage is fault-tolerant, transparently handling the loss of up to two copies of data without affecting database write availability and up to three copies without affecting read availability. Amazon Aurora storage is also self-healing. Data blocks and disks are continuously scanned for errors and replaced automatically.Increased Availability -You also benefit from enhanced database availability when running Multi-AZ deployments. If an Availability Zone failure or DB Instance failure occurs, your availability impact is limited to the time automatic failover takes to complete: typically under one minute for Amazon Aurora and one to two minutes for other database engines (see theRDS FAQ -for details).The availability benefits of Multi-AZ deployments also extend to planned maintenance and backups. In the case of system upgrades like OS patching or DBInstance scaling, these operations are applied first on the standby, prior to the automatic failover. As a result, your availability impact is, again, only the time required for automatic failover to complete.Unlike Single-AZ deployments, I/O activity is not suspended on your primary during backup for Multi-AZ deployments for the MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL engines, because the backup is taken from the standby. However, note that you may still experience elevated latencies for a few minutes during backups for Multi-AZ deployments.On instance failure in Amazon Aurora deployments, Amazon RDS uses RDS Multi-AZ technology to automate failover to one of up to 15 Amazon Aurora Replicas you have created in any of three Availability Zones.

Use SSL to encrypt the connection between the two databases. Monitor the replication performance by watching the RDS ReplicaLag metric. During the application maintenance window, shut down the on-premises database and switch over the application connection to the RDS instance when there is no more replication lag.

Create a backup of the source database using the supported tools. During the application maintenance window, restore the backup into the Oracle database running in the EC2 instance. Set up an Amazon RDS for Oracle instance, and create an import job between the databases hosted in AWS. Shut down the source database and switch over the database connections to the RDS instance when the job is complete.\n                                                </li>\n<li class=\"multi-choice-item correct-hidden\">\n<span class=\"multi-choice-letter\">\n                                                        C.\n                                                    </span>\n                                                    \n                                                    Use AWS DMS to load and replicate the dataset between the on-premises Oracle database and the replication instance hosted on AWS. Provision an Amazon RDS for Oracle instance with Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) enabled and configure it as a target for the replication instance. Create a customer-managed AWS KMS master key to set it as the encryption key for the replication instance. Use AWS DMS tasks to load the data into the target RDS instance. During the application maintenance window and after the load tasks reach the ongoing replication phase, switch the database connections to the new database.\n                                                </li>\n<li class=\"multi-choice-item\">\n<span class=\"multi-choice-letter\">\n                                                        D.\n                                                    </span>\n                                                    \n                                                    Create a compressed full database backup of the on-premises Oracle database during an application maintenance window. While the backup is being performed, provision a 10 Gbps AWS Direct Connect connection to increase the transfer speed of the database backup files to Amazon S3, and shorten the maintenance window period. Use SSL/TLS to copy the files over the Direct Connect connection. When the backup files are successfully copied, start the maintenance window, and rise any of the Amazon RDS supported tools to import the data into a newly provisioned Amazon RDS for Oracle instance with encryption enabled. Wait until the data is fully loaded and switch over the database connections to the new database. Delete the Direct Connect connection to cut unnecessary charges.\n                                                </li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<a class=\"btn btn-primary reveal-solution\" href=\"#\">Show Suggested Answer</a>\n<a class=\"btn btn-primary hide-solution d-none\" href=\"#\">Hide Answer</a>\n<p class=\"card-text question-answer bg-light white-text\">\n<span class=\"correct-answer-box\"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong>\n<span class=\"correct-answer\">C</span> <br/></span>\n<span class=\"answer-description\">\n                                        Reference:<br/>https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/oracle-database-encryption-options-on-amazon-rds/ https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Appendix.Oracle.Options.AdvSecurity.htm<br/>(DMS in transit encryption)<br/>https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_Security.html\n                                    </span>\n</p>\n</div>\n<!-- / Question  -->\n<div class=\"discussion-meta-data mt-3 pt-1 border-top\">\n                                    by\n                                    \n                                    <a class=\"title-username\" href=\"/user/donathon/\" style=\"\">\n<i class=\"fa fa-user-o\"></i>\n                                        donathon\n                                    </a>\n                                    \n                                    at <i>\n                                    Sept. 25, 2019, 3:28 a.m.</i>\n</div>\n</div>", "que": ["A company is moving a business-critical application onto AWS.

It assigns the storage class to an object when it is written to<br/>Amazon S3. You can assign objects a specific storage class (standard or reduced redundancy) only when you write the objects to an Amazon S3 bucket or when you copy objects that are already stored in Amazon S3. Standard is the default storage class. For information about storage classes, see<br/><br/>Object Key and -<br/><br/>Metadata -<br/>.<br/>In order to reduce storage costs, you can use reduced redundancy storage for noncritical, reproducible data at lower levels of redundancy than Amazon S3 provides with standard storage. The lower level of redundancy results in less durability and availability, but in many cases, the lower costs can make reduced redundancy storage an acceptable storage solution. For example, it can be a cost-effective solution for sharing media content that is durably stored elsewhere. It can also make sense if you are storing thumbnails and other resized images that can be easily reproduced from an original image.<br/>Reduced redundancy storage is designed to provide 99.99% durability of objects over a given year. This durability level corresponds to an average annual expected loss of 0.01% of objects. For example, if you store 10,000 objects using the RRS option, you can, on average, expect to incur an annual loss of a single object per year (0.01% of 10,000 objects).<br/>Note:<br/>This annual loss represents an expected average and does not guarantee the loss of less than 0.01% of objects in a given year.<br/>Reduced redundancy storage stores objects on multiple devices across multiple facilities, providing 400 times the durability of a typical disk drive, but it does not replicate objects as many times as Amazon S3 standard storage. In addition, reduced redundancy storage is designed to sustain the loss of data in a single facility.<br/>If an object in reduced redundancy storage has been lost, Amazon S3 will return a 405 error on requests made to that object. Amazon S3 also offers notifications for reduced redundancy storage object loss: you can configure your bucket so that when Amazon S3 detects the loss of an RRS object, a notification will be sent through Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS). You can then replace the lost object. To enable notifications, you can use the Amazon S3 console to set the Notifications property of your bucket.<br/><img class=\"in-exam-image\" src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/03759/0004200001.png\"/>\n</span>\n</p>\n</div>\n<!-- / Question  -->\n<div class=\"discussion-meta-data mt-3 pt-1 border-top\">\n                                    by\n                                    \n                                    <a class=\"title-username\" href=\"/user/ExtHo/\" style=\"\">\n<i class=\"fa fa-user-o\"></i>\n                                        ExtHo\n                                    </a>\n                                    \n                                    at <i>\n                                    March 18, 2021, 3:06 a.m.</i>\n</div>\n</div>", "que": ["Your department creates regular analytics reports from your company's log files All log data is collected in Amazon S3 and processed by daily Amazon ElasticMapReduce (EMR) jobs that generate daily PDF reports and aggregated tables in CSV format for an Amazon Redshift data warehouse.Your CFO requests that you optimize the cost structure for this system.Which of the following alternatives will lower costs without compromising average performance of the system or data integrity for the raw data?", "Suggested Answer:\nC \n\n                                        Using Reduced Redundancy Storage Amazon S3 stores objects according to their storage class. It assigns the storage class to an object when it is written toAmazon S3. You can assign objects a specific storage class (standard or reduced redundancy) only when you write the objects to an Amazon S3 bucket or when you copy objects that are already stored in Amazon S3. Standard is the default storage class. For information about storage classes, seeObject Key and -Metadata -.In order to reduce storage costs, you can use reduced redundancy storage for noncritical, reproducible data at lower levels of redundancy than Amazon S3 provides with standard storage. The lower level of redundancy results in less durability and availability, but in many cases, the lower costs can make reduced redundancy storage an acceptable storage solution. For example, it can be a cost-effective solution for sharing media content that is durably stored elsewhere. It can also make sense if you are storing thumbnails and other resized images that can be easily reproduced from an original image.Reduced redundancy storage is designed to provide 99.99% durability of objects over a given year. This durability level corresponds to an average annual expected loss of 0.01% of objects. For example, if you store 10,000 objects using the RRS option, you can, on average, expect to incur an annual loss of a single object per year (0.01% of 10,000 objects).Note:This annual loss represents an expected average and does not guarantee the loss of less than 0.01% of objects in a given year.Reduced redundancy storage stores objects on multiple devices across multiple facilities, providing 400 times the durability of a typical disk drive, but it does not replicate objects as many times as Amazon S3 standard storage. In addition, reduced redundancy storage is designed to sustain the loss of data in a single facility.If an object in reduced redundancy storage has been lost, Amazon S3 will return a 405 error on requests made to that object. Amazon S3 also offers notifications for reduced redundancy storage object loss: you can configure your bucket so that when Amazon S3 detects the loss of an RRS object, a notification will be sent through Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS).

The artifact consumers will be migrated to Amazon EC2 instances located within both public and private subnets in a virtual private cloud (VPC).Which solution will permit the artifact consumers to download artifacts without modifying the existing automation scripts?", "Suggested Answer:\nB"], "que_header": "<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 459<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>", "ans": "Suggested Answer:\nB ", "ans_details": "\n"}, {"name": "Exam AWS DevOps Engineer Professional topic 1 question 54 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/8041-exam-aws-devops-engineer-professional-topic-1-question-54/", "reply": "18", "views": "2628", "username": "marwan", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            benLLP\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 2Â months ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-devops-engineer-professional/\">\n                                    AWS DevOps Engineer Professional\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 54<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-devops-engineer-professional/\">\n                                    [All AWS DevOps Engineer Professional Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"675507\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">A DevOps Engineer is designing a deployment strategy for a web application.

Back up the MySQL database frequently, and in the event of a failure in an active region, copy the backup to the standby region and restore the standby database.\n                                                </li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<a class=\"btn btn-primary reveal-solution\" href=\"#\">Show Suggested Answer</a>\n<a class=\"btn btn-primary hide-solution d-none\" href=\"#\">Hide Answer</a>\n<p class=\"card-text question-answer bg-light white-text\">\n<span class=\"correct-answer-box\"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong>\n<span class=\"correct-answer\">A</span> <br/></span>\n<span class=\"answer-description\">\n</span>\n</p>\n</div>\n<!-- / Question  -->\n<div class=\"discussion-meta-data mt-3 pt-1 border-top\">\n                                    by\n                                    \n                                    <a class=\"title-username\" href=\"/user/donathon/\" style=\"\">\n<i class=\"fa fa-user-o\"></i>\n                                        donathon\n                                    </a>\n                                    \n                                    at <i>\n                                    Sept. 26, 2019, 6:09 a.m.</i>\n</div>\n</div>", "que": ["A companyג€™s application is increasingly popular and experiencing latency because of high volume reads on the database server.The service has the following properties:✑ A highly available REST API hosted in one region using Application Load Balancer (ALB) with auto scaling.✑ A MySQL database hosted on an Amazon EC2 instance in a single Availability Zone.The company wants to reduce latency, increase in-region database read performance, and have multi-region disaster recovery capabilities that can perform a live recovery automatically without any data or performance loss (HA/DR).Which deployment strategy will meet these requirements?", "Suggested Answer:\nA"], "que_header": "<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 455<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>", "ans": "Suggested Answer:\nA ", "ans_details": "\n"}, {"name": "Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional topic 1 question 452 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/5949-exam-aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional-topic-1/", "reply": "20", "views": "3916", "username": "cmm103", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            Waiweng\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 2Â months ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 452<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"675155\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">A company wants to move a web application to AWS.

However, in complex configurations, you use a combination of alias resource record sets (including weighted alias, latency alias, and failover alias) and nonalias resource record sets to build a decision tree that gives you greater control over how Amazon Route 53 responds to requests. For more information, see<br/>How Health Checks Work in Simple Amazon Route 53<br/><br/>Configurations -<br/>.<br/>For example, you might use latency alias resource record sets to select a region close to a user and use weighted resource record sets for two or more resources within each region to protect against the failure of a single endpoint or an Availability Zone. The following diagram shows this configuration.<br/><img class=\"in-exam-image\" src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/03759/0002700001.png\"/><br/>Here's how Amazon EC2 and Amazon Route 53 are configured:<br/>You have Amazon EC2 instances in two regions, us-east-1 and ap-southeast-2. You want Amazon Route 53 to respond to queries by using the resource record sets in the region that provides the lowest latency for your customers, so you create a latency alias resource record set for each region. (You create the latency alias resource record sets after you create resource record sets for the individual Amazon EC2 instances.)<br/>Within each region, you have two Amazon EC2 instances. You create a weighted resource record set for each instance. The name and the type are the same for both of the weighted resource record sets in each region.<br/>When you have multiple resources in a region, you can create weighted or failover resource record sets for your resources. You can also create even more complex configurations by creating weighted alias or failover alias resource record sets that, in turn, refer to multiple resources.<br/>Each weighted resource record set has an associated health check. The IP address for each health check matches the IP address for the corresponding resource record set. This isn't required, but it's the most common configuration.<br/>For both latency alias resource record sets, you set the value of Evaluate Target Health to Yes.<br/>You use the Evaluate Target Health setting for each latency alias resource record set to make Amazon Route 53 evaluate the health of the alias targetsג€\"the weighted resource record setsג€\"and respond accordingly.<br/><img class=\"in-exam-image\" src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/03759/0002900001.png\"/><br/>The preceding diagram illustrates the following sequence of events:<br/>Amazon Route 53 receives a query for example.com. Based on the latency for the user making the request, Amazon Route 53 selects the latency alias resource record set for the us-east-1 region.<br/>Amazon Route 53 selects a weighted resource record set based on weight. Evaluate Target Health is Yes for the latency alias resource record set, so Amazon<br/>Route 53 checks the health of the selected weighted resource record set.<br/>The health check failed, so Amazon Route 53 chooses another weighted resource record set based on weight and checks its health. That resource record set also is unhealthy.<br/>Amazon Route 53 backs out of that branch of the tree, looks for the latency alias resource record set with the next-best latency, and chooses the resource record set for ap-southeast-2.<br/>Amazon Route 53 again selects a resource record set based on weight, and then checks the health of the selected resource record set. The health check passed, so Amazon Route 53 returns the applicable value in response to the query.<br/>What Happens When You Associate a Health Check with an Alias Resource Record Set?<br/>You can associate a health check with an alias resource record set instead of or in addition to setting the value of Evaluate Target Health to Yes. However, it's generally more useful if Amazon Route 53 responds to queries based on the health of the underlying resourcesג€\"the HTTP servers, database servers, and other resources that your alias resource record sets refer to. For example, suppose the following configuration:<br/>You assign a health check to a latency alias resource record set for which the alias target is a group of weighted resource record sets.<br/>You set the value of Evaluate Target Health to Yes for the latency alias resource record set.<br/>In this configuration, both of the following must be true before Amazon Route 53 will return the applicable value for a weighted resource record set:<br/>The health check associated with the latency alias resource record set must pass.<br/>At least one weighted resource record set must be considered healthy, either because it's associated with a health check that passes or because it's not associated with a health check. In the latter case, Amazon Route 53 always considers the weighted resource record set healthy.<br/><img class=\"in-exam-image\" src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/03759/0003000001.png\"/><br/>If the health check for the latency alias resource record set fails, Amazon Route 53 stops responding to queries using any of the weighted resource record sets in the alias target, even if they're all healthy. Amazon Route 53 doesn't know the status of the weighted resource record sets because it never looks past the failed health check on the alias resource record set.<br/>What Happens When You Omit Health Checks?<br/>In a complex configuration, it's important to associate health checks with all of the non-alias resource record sets. Let's return to the preceding example, but assume that a health check is missing on one of the weighted resource record sets in the us-east-1 region:<br/><img class=\"in-exam-image\" src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/03759/0003100001.png\"/><br/>Here's what happens when you omit a health check on a non-alias resource record set in this configuration:<br/>Amazon Route 53 receives a query for example.com. Based on the latency for the user making the request, Amazon Route 53 selects the latency alias resource record set for the us-east-1 region.<br/>Amazon Route 53 looks up the alias target for the latency alias resource record set, and checks the status of the corresponding health checks. The health check for one weighted resource record set failed, so that resource record set is omitted from consideration.<br/>The other weighted resource record set in the alias target for the us-east-1 region has no health check. The corresponding resource might or might not be healthy, but without a health check, Amazon Route 53 has no way to know. Amazon Route 53 assumes that the resource is healthy and returns the applicable value in response to the query.<br/>What Happens When You Set Evaluate Target Health to No?<br/>In general, you also want to set Evaluate Target Health to Yes for all of the alias resource record sets. In the following example, all of the weighted resource record sets have associated health checks, but Evaluate Target Health is set to No for the latency alias resource record set for the us-east-1 region:<br/><img class=\"in-exam-image\" src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/03759/0003200001.png\"/><br/>Here's what happens when you set Evaluate Target Health to No for an alias resource record set in this configuration:<br/>Amazon Route 53 receives a query for example.com.

They're both failing.Because the value of Evaluate Target Health is No for the latency alias resource record set for the us-east-1 region, Amazon Route 53 must choose one resource record set in this branch instead of backing out of the branch and looking for a healthy resource record set in the ap-southeast-2 region.\n                                    "}, {"name": "Exam AWS-SysOps topic 1 question 69 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/10811-exam-aws-sysops-topic-1-question-69-discussion/", "reply": "10", "views": "1764", "username": "karmaah", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            RicardoD\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 2Â months, 1Â week ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-sysops/\">\n                                    AWS-SysOps\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 69<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-sysops/\">\n                                    [All AWS-SysOps Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"704571\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">[1]<br/>does this policy define?<br/><img class=\"in-exam-image\" src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/03859/0003700001.png\"/><br/></p>\n<div class=\"question-choices-container\">\n<ul>\n<li class=\"multi-choice-item correct-hidden\">\n<span class=\"multi-choice-letter\">\n                                                        A.\n                                                    </span>\n                                                    \n                                                    It is not possible to define a policy at the object level\n                                                </li>\n<li class=\"multi-choice-item\">\n<span class=\"multi-choice-letter\">\n                                                        B.\n                                                    </span>\n                                                    \n                                                    It will make all the objects of the bucket cloudacademy as public\n                                                </li>\n<li class=\"multi-choice-item\">\n<span class=\"multi-choice-letter\">\n                                                        C.\n                                                    </span>\n                                                    \n                                                    It will make the bucket cloudacademy as public [1]\n                                                </li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<a class=\"btn btn-primary reveal-solution\" href=\"#\">Show Suggested Answer</a>\n<a class=\"btn btn-primary hide-solution d-none\" href=\"#\">Hide Answer</a>\n<p class=\"card-text question-answer bg-light white-text\">\n<span class=\"correct-answer-box\"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong>\n<span class=\"correct-answer\">A</span> <br/></span>\n<span class=\"answer-description\">\n                                        A system admin can grant permission to the S3 objects or buckets to any user or make objects public using the bucket policy and user policy.

Thus, it can come only from the source security group provided by Elastic Load Balancing.\n                                    "}, {"name": "Exam AWS-SysOps topic 1 question 86 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/15358-exam-aws-sysops-topic-1-question-86-discussion/", "reply": "3", "views": "889", "username": "awscertified", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            RicardoD\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 2Â months, 1Â week ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-sysops/\">\n                                    AWS-SysOps\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 86<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-sysops/\">\n                                    [All AWS-SysOps Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"704588\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">A system admin is managing buckets, objects and folders with AWS S3.

A typical Amazon Kinesis Streams application reads data from an Amazon Kinesis stream as data records. These applications can use the Amazon Kinesis Client Library, and they can run on Amazon EC2 instances. The processed records can be sent to dashboards, used to generate alerts, dynamically change pricing and advertising strategies, or send data to a variety of other AWS services.
