Monitoring shows that the EC2 instance CPU utilization increased from 50% to 70%, but the total random IOPS measured at the instance level does not increase at all.What is the problem and a valid solution?", "Suggested Answer:\nB"], "que_header": "<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 23<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>", "ans": "Suggested Answer:\nB ", "ans_details": "\n"}, {"name": "Exam AWS Certified Database - Specialty topic 1 question 90 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/48681-exam-aws-certified-database-specialty-topic-1-question-90/", "reply": "5", "views": "232", "username": "std2021", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            Aesthet\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 1Â month, 2Â weeks ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-database-specialty/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Database - Specialty\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 90<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-database-specialty/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Database - Specialty Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"657249\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">Developers have requested a new Amazon Redshift cluster so they can load new third-party marketing data.

To achieve this, a solutions architect has split the single metadata extraction Lambda function into a Lambda function for each type of metadata.Which additional steps should the solutions architect take to meet the requirements?", "Suggested Answer:\nC"], "que_header": "<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 664<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>", "ans": "Suggested Answer:\nC ", "ans_details": "\n"}, {"name": "Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional topic 1 question 669 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/36631-exam-aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional-topic-1/", "reply": "19", "views": "1746", "username": "keos", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            Waiweng\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 1Â month, 2Â weeks ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 669<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"675372\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">A Solutions Architect is building a solution for updating user metadata that is initiated by web servers.

You can use any method that is supported by Amazon S3 to get your objects into Amazon S3, for example, the Amazon S3 console or API, or a third-party tool. You can create a hierarchy in your bucket to store the objects, just as you would with any other Amazon S3 bucket.<br/>Using an existing Amazon S3 bucket as your CloudFront origin server doesn't change the bucket in any way; you can still use it as you normally would to store and access Amazon S3 objects at the standard Amazon S3 price.
