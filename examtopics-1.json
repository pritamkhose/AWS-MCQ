When responding to queries, Route 53 includes only the healthy primary resources. If all the primary resources are unhealthy, Route 53 begins to include only the healthy secondary resources in response to<br/>DNS queries.<br/>To create an active-passive failover configuration with one primary record and one secondary record, you just create the records and specify Failover for the routing policy. When the primary resource is healthy, Route 53 responds to DNS queries using the primary record. When the primary resource is unhealthy, Route<br/>53 responds to DNS queries using the secondary record.<br/>How Amazon Route 53 averts cascading failures<br/>As a first defense against cascading failures, each request routing algorithm (such as weighted and failover) has a mode of last resort. In this special mode, when all records are considered unhealthy, the Route 53 algorithm reverts to considering all records healthy.<br/>For example, if all instances of an application, on several hosts, are rejecting health check requests, Route 53 DNS servers will choose an answer anyway and return it rather than returning no DNS answer or returning an NXDOMAIN (non-existent domain) response. An application can respond to users but still fail health checks, so this provides some protection against misconfiguration.<br/>Similarly, if an application is overloaded, and one out of three endpoints fails its health checks, so that it's excluded from Route 53 DNS responses, Route 53 distributes responses between the two remaining endpoints. If the remaining endpoints are unable to handle the additional load and they fail, Route 53 reverts to distributing requests to all three endpoints.<br/>Reference:<br/>https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-types.html https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-problems.html\n                                    </span>\n</p>\n</div>\n<!-- / Question  -->\n<div class=\"discussion-meta-data mt-3 pt-1 border-top\">\n                                    by\n                                    \n                                    <a class=\"title-username\" href=\"/user/sarth83/\" style=\"\">\n<i class=\"fa fa-user-o\"></i>\n                                        sarth83\n                                    </a>\n                                    \n                                    at <i>\n                                    June 1, 2020, 12:36 p.m.</i>\n</div>\n</div>", "que": ["A solutions architect is designing a solution where users will be directed to a backup static error page if the primary website is unavailable.

The database backend is hosted on Amazon RDS for MySQL with a primary instance and five read replicas to support scaling needs. The read replicas should lag no more than 1 second behind the primary instance to support the user experience.As traffic on the website continues to increase, the replicas are falling further behind during periods of peak load, resulting in complaints from users when searches yield inconsistent results. A solutions architect needs to reduce the replication lag as much as possible, with minimal changes to the application code or operational requirements.Which solution meets these requirements?", "Suggested Answer:\nB"], "que_header": "<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate SAA-C02\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 394<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate SAA-C02 Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>", "ans": "Suggested Answer:\nB ", "ans_details": "\n"}, {"name": "Exam AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner topic 1 question 530 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/43807-exam-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-topic-1-question-530/", "reply": "12", "views": "1416", "username": "lizliz", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            Lexzy\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 23Â hours, 36Â minutes ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 530<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"704361\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">What are the benefits of consolidated billing for AWS Cloud services?

class=\"card-text\">A university is running an internal web application on AWS that students can access from the university network to check their exam results. The web application runs on Amazon EC2 instances and pulls results from an Amazon DynamoDB table. Auto Scaling is currently configured to add a new web server when CPU is greater than 80% for 5 minutes. DynamoDB is configured to increase both read and write capacity units by five when utilization is greater than 80%. Exam results are released at 9:00 a.m. each Monday, and 80% of students, attempt to access their unique result within the first 30 minutes. Despite Auto Scaling being enabled, students are complaining of slow response times and errors when they view the site.

Users accessing these websites will be routed to appropriate backend Amazon EC2 instances based on the subdomain. The websites host static webpages, images, and server-side scripts like PHP and<br/>JavaScript.<br/>Some of the websites experience peak access during the first two hours of business with constant usage throughout the rest of the day. A solutions architect needs to design a solution that will automatically adjust capacity to these traffic patterns while keeping costs low.<br/>Which combination of AWS services or features will meet these requirements?

This question states that Subnet 3 reserves 172.16.12.130 for the VPC router. Given that we now know that the Subnet 3 (the 1st of the last 4 Subnets) starts at 172.16.12.128 - then it must follow that Subnet2 ends at 172.16.12.127. From here we know we have 128 addresses that are halved evenly between Subnet1 and Subnet2 - 128/2<br/>= 64 or /26 in CIDR form. Therefore it follows that the address reserved by AWS for DNS in the Subnet2 must be 172.16.12.66<br/>Reference:<br/>http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Subnets.html\n                                    </span>\n</p>\n</div>\n<!-- / Question  -->\n<div class=\"discussion-meta-data mt-3 pt-1 border-top\">\n                                    by\n                                    \n                                    <a class=\"title-username\" href=\"/user/Souslik1999/\" style=\"\">\n<i class=\"fa fa-user-o\"></i>\n                                        Souslik1999\n                                    </a>\n                                    \n                                    at <i>\n                                    Nov. 22, 2020, 8:10 a.m.</i>\n</div>\n</div>", "que": ["You have just provisioned a new VPC a with a CIDR block of 172.16.12.0/24.

A higher CIDR is the same as a more specific prefix, which will make the link more preferred. A higher<br/>MED will make the path less preferred, but this is not the preferred method to accomplish this. Changing your ASN will not help.
