Amazon RDS replicates all databases in the source DB instance.Reference:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_ReadRepl.html\n                                    "}, {"name": "Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate SAA-C02 topic 1 question 330 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/46401-exam-aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02/", "reply": "13", "views": "2366", "username": "dmscountera", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            enurupu\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 2Â weeks, 3Â days ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate SAA-C02\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 330<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate SAA-C02 Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"690770\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">A solution architect needs to design a highly available application consisting of web, application, and database tiers.

You receive millions of images at a time, but only 3 times per day on average.

The Solutions Architect has been asked to reduce the cost of the application.Which solution is MOST cost-effective?", "Suggested Answer:\nD \n\n                                        Reference:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring_ec2.html"], "que_header": "<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 542<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>", "ans": "Suggested Answer:\nD ", "ans_details": "\n                                        Reference:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring_ec2.html\n                                    "}, {"name": "Exam AWS Certified Database - Specialty topic 1 question 59 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/25738-exam-aws-certified-database-specialty-topic-1-question-59/", "reply": "13", "views": "1083", "username": "Mickysingh", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            Suresh108\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 2Â weeks, 4Â days ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-database-specialty/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Database - Specialty\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 59<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-database-specialty/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Database - Specialty Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"657218\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">An IT consulting company wants to reduce costs when operating its development environment databases.

queue length is the number of pending I/O requests for a device. The optimal average queue length will vary for every customer workload, and this value depends on a particular application's sensitivity to IOPS and latency. If the workload is not delivering enough I/O requests to maintain the optimal average queue length, then the EBS volume might not consistently deliver the IOPS that have been provisioned. However, if the workload maintains an average queue length that is higher than the optimal value, then the per-request I/O latency will increase; in this case, the user should provision more IOPS for his volume.

The developers are unable to replicate this issue and have asked a database specialist for a recommendation.Which recommendation would resolve this issue?", "Suggested Answer:\nC"], "que_header": "<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-database-specialty/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Database - Specialty\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 104<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-database-specialty/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Database - Specialty Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>", "ans": "Suggested Answer:\nC ", "ans_details": "\n"}, {"name": "Exam AWS Certified Database - Specialty topic 1 question 101 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/50908-exam-aws-certified-database-specialty-topic-1-question-101/", "reply": "4", "views": "182", "username": "manan728", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            Suresh108\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 2Â weeks, 6Â days ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-database-specialty/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Database - Specialty\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 101<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-database-specialty/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Database - Specialty Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"657260\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">A database specialist deployed an Amazon RDS DB instance in Dev-VPC1 used by their development team.

It enables the user to launch AWS resources, such as RDS into a virtual network that the user has defined. Subnets are segments of a VPC's IP address range that the user can designate to a group of VPC resources based on security and operational needs. A DB subnet group is a collection of subnets (generally private) that the user can create in a VPC and assign to the RDS DB instances. ADB subnet group allows the user to specify a particular VPC when creating the DB instances.Each DB subnet group should have subnets in at least two Availability Zones in a given region.

E would not take advantage of the already existing Direct Connect connection.\n                                    "}, {"name": "Exam ANS-C00 topic 1 question 338 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/53433-exam-ans-c00-topic-1-question-338-discussion/", "reply": "2", "views": "40", "username": "ChauPhan", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            namirmatar\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 3Â weeks, 1Â day ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/ans-c00/\">\n                                    ANS-C00\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 338<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/ans-c00/\">\n                                    [All ANS-C00 Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"603175\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">An AWS account owner has setup multiple IAM users.

You build an application that users can run on their computers. On the back end, the application reads and writes objects in an S3 bucket. Users donג€™t have direct access to AWS. Instead, the application communicates with an identity provider (IdP) to authenticate the user. The IdP gets the user information from your organizationג€™s identity store (such as an LDAP directory) and then generates a SAML assertion that includes authentication and authorization information about that user. The application then uses that assertion to make a call to the AssumeRoleWithSAML API to get temporary security credentials.
