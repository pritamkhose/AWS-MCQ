Amazon S3 deletes expired objects on your behalf.The lifecycle expiration costs depend on when you choose to expire objects.Reference:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/snowball/latest/ug/limits.htmlhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html\n                                    "}, {"name": "Exam AWS DevOps Engineer Professional topic 1 question 149 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/46928-exam-aws-devops-engineer-professional-topic-1-question-149/", "reply": "4", "views": "325", "username": "Rajarshi", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            okida\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 1Â month ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-devops-engineer-professional/\">\n                                    AWS DevOps Engineer Professional\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 149<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-devops-engineer-professional/\">\n                                    [All AWS DevOps Engineer Professional Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"675602\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">A DevOps Engineer must implement monitoring for a workload running on Amazon EC2 and Amazon RDS MySQL.

The AWS product puts metrics into this repository, and the user can retrieve the data or statistics based on those metrics. To distinguish the data for each service, the CloudWatch metric has a namespace. Namespaces are containers for metrics. All AWS services that provide the Amazon CloudWatch data use a namespace string, beginning with \"AWS/\". All the services which are supported by CloudWatch will have some namespace. CloudWatch does not monitor CloudTrail.

Files are uploaded by users who connect to a web server, which stores them on an Amazon EFS share. This web server is running on a single Amazon EC2 instance. A different group of instances, running in an Auto Scaling group, scans the EFS share directory structure for new files to process and generates new videos (thumbnails, different resolution, compression, etc.) according to the instructions file, which is uploaded along with the video files. A different application running on a group of instances managed by an Auto Scaling group processes the video files and then deletes them from theEFS share. The results are stored in an S3 bucket.

So, for example, if a process that is reading messages from the queue fails, messages can still be added to the queue to be processed when the system recovers.Reference:https://www.botmetric.com/blog/aws-cloud-architecture-design-principles/\n                                    "}, {"name": "Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional topic 1 question 610 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/28344-exam-aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional-topic-1/", "reply": "14", "views": "2650", "username": "Konnon", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            pradhyumna\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 1Â month ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 610<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"675313\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">A company has an internal application running on AWS that is used to track and process shipments in the companyג€™s warehouse.

Call duration is mostly in the 2-3 minutes timeframe. Each traced call can be either active or terminated. An external application needs to know each minute the list of currently active calls. Usually there are a few calls/second, but once per month there is a periodic peak up to 1000 calls/second for a few hours. The system is open 24/7 and any downtime should be avoided. Historical data is periodically archived to files.

If you need to use a Condition element with one or more of these resources, you must create multiple statements as shown in this example.<br/>The following policy allows users to attach volumes with the tag \"volume_user=iam-user-name\" to instances with the tag \"department=dev\", and to detach those volumes from those instances. If you attach this policy to an IAM group, the aws:username policy variable gives each IAM user in the group permission to attach or detach volumes from the instances with a tag named volume_user that has his or her IAM user name as a value.<br/>{<br/>\"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",<br/>\"Statement\": [{<br/>\"Effect\": \"Allow\",<br/>\"Action\": [<br/>\"ec2:AttachVolume\",<br/>\"ec2:DetachVolume\"<br/>],<br/>\"Resource\": \"arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:123456789012:instance/*\",<br/>\"Condition\": {<br/>\"StringEquals\": {<br/>\"ec2:ResourceTag/department\": \"dev\"<br/>}<br/>}<br/>},<br/>{<br/>\"Effect\": \"Allow\",<br/>\"Action\": [<br/>\"ec2:AttachVolume\",<br/>\"ec2:DetachVolume\"<br/>],<br/>\"Resource\": \"arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:123456789012:volume/*\",<br/>\"Condition\": {<br/>\"StringEquals\": {<br/>\"ec2:ResourceTag/volume_user\": \"${aws:username}\"<br/>}<br/>}<br/>}<br/>]<br/>}<br/>Launching instances (RunInstances)<br/><br/>The -<br/><br/>RunInstances -<br/>API action launches one or more instances. RunInstances requires an AMI and creates an instance; and users can specify a key pair and security group in the request. Launching into EC2-VPC requires a subnet, and creates a network interface. Launching from an Amazon EBS-backed AMI creates a volume. Therefore, the user must have permission to use these Amazon EC2 resources. The caller can also configure the instance using optional parameters to<br/>RunInstances, such as the instance type and a subnet. You can create a policy statement that requires users to specify an optional parameter, or restricts users to particular values for a parameter. The examples in this section demonstrate some of the many possible ways that you can control the configuration of an instance that a user can launch.<br/>Note that by default, users don't have permission to describe, start, stop, or terminate the resulting instances. One way to grant the users permission to manage the resulting instances is to create a specific tag for each instance, and then create a statement that enables them to manage instances with that tag. For more information, see<br/>2: Working with instances<br/>.<br/>a. AMI<br/>The following policy allows users to launch instances using only the AMIs that have the specified tag, \"department=dev\", associated with them. The users can't launch instances using other AMIs because the Condition element of the first statement requires that users specify an AMI that has this tag. The users also can't launch into a subnet, as the policy does not grant permissions for the subnet and network interface resources. They can, however, launch into EC2-Classic. The second statement uses a wildcard to enable users to create instance resources, and requires users to specify the key pair project_keypair and the security group sg-1a2b3c4d. Users are still able to launch instances without a key pair.<br/>{<br/>\"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",<br/>\"Statement\": [{<br/>\"Effect\": \"Allow\",<br/>\"Action\": \"ec2:RunInstances\",<br/>\"Resource\": [<br/>\"arn:aws:ec2:region::image/ami-*\"<br/>],<br/>\"Condition\": {<br/>\"StringEquals\": {<br/>\"ec2:ResourceTag/department\": \"dev\"<br/>}<br/>}<br/>},<br/>{<br/>\"Effect\": \"Allow\",<br/>\"Action\": \"ec2:RunInstances\",<br/>\"Resource\": [<br/>\"arn:aws:ec2:region:account:instance/*\",<br/>\"arn:aws:ec2:region:account:volume/*\",<br/>\"arn:aws:ec2:region:account:key-pair/project_keypair\",<br/>\"arn:aws:ec2:region:account:security-group/sg-1a2b3c4d\"<br/>]<br/>}<br/>]<br/>}<br/>Alternatively, the following policy allows users to launch instances using only the specified AMIs, ami-9e1670f7 and ami-45cf5c3c. The users can't launch an instance using other AMIs (unless another statement grants the users permission to do so), and the users can't launch an instance into a subnet.<br/>{<br/>\"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",<br/>\"Statement\": [{<br/>\"Effect\": \"Allow\",<br/>\"Action\": \"ec2:RunInstances\",<br/>\"Resource\": [<br/>\"arn:aws:ec2:region::image/ami-9e1670f7\",<br/>\"arn:aws:ec2:region::image/ami-45cf5c3c\",<br/>\"arn:aws:ec2:region:account:instance/*\",<br/>\"arn:aws:ec2:region:account:volume/*\",<br/>\"arn:aws:ec2:region:account:key-pair/*\",<br/>\"arn:aws:ec2:region:account:security-group/*\"<br/>]<br/>}<br/>]<br/>}<br/>Alternatively, the following policy allows users to launch instances from all AMIs owned by Amazon. The Condition element of the first statement tests whether ec2:Owner is amazon. The users can't launch an instance using other AMIs (unless another statement grants the users permission to do so). The users are able to launch an instance into a subnet.<br/>{<br/>\"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",<br/>\"Statement\": [{<br/>\"Effect\": \"Allow\",<br/>\"Action\": \"ec2:RunInstances\",<br/>\"Resource\": [<br/>\"arn:aws:ec2:region::image/ami-*\"<br/>],<br/>\"Condition\": {<br/>\"StringEquals\": {<br/>\"ec2:Owner\": \"amazon\"<br/>}<br/>}<br/>},<br/>{<br/>\"Effect\": \"Allow\",<br/>\"Action\": \"ec2:RunInstances\",<br/>\"Resource\": [<br/>\"arn:aws:ec2:region:account:instance/*\",<br/>\"arn:aws:ec2:region:account:subnet/*\",<br/>\"arn:aws:ec2:region:account:volume/*\",<br/>\"arn:aws:ec2:region:account:network-interface/*\",<br/>\"arn:aws:ec2:region:account:key-pair/*\",<br/>\"arn:aws:ec2:region:account:security-group/*\"<br/>]<br/>}<br/>]<br/>}<br/>b. Instance type<br/>The following policy allows users to launch instances using only the t2.micro or t2.small instance type, which you might do to control costs. The users can't launch larger instances because the Condition element of the first statement tests whether ec2:InstanceType is either t2.micro or t2.small.<br/>{<br/>\"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",<br/>\"Statement\": [{<br/>\"Effect\": \"Allow\",<br/>\"Action\": \"ec2:RunInstances\",<br/>\"Resource\": [<br/>\"arn:aws:ec2:region:account:instance/*\"<br/>],<br/>\"Condition\": {<br/>\"StringEquals\": {<br/>\"ec2:InstanceType\": [\"t2.micro\", \"t2.small\"]<br/>}<br/>}<br/>},<br/>{<br/>\"Effect\": \"Allow\",<br/>\"Action\": \"ec2:RunInstances\",<br/>\"Resource\": [<br/>\"arn:aws:ec2:region::image/ami-*\",<br/>\"arn:aws:ec2:region:account:subnet/*\",<br/>\"arn:aws:ec2:region:account:network-interface/*\",<br/>\"arn:aws:ec2:region:account:volume/*\",<br/>\"arn:aws:ec2:region:account:key-pair/*\",<br/>\"arn:aws:ec2:region:account:security-group/*\"<br/>]<br/>}<br/>]<br/>}<br/>Alternatively, you can create a policy that denies users permission to launch any instances except t2.micro and t2.small instance types.<br/>{<br/>\"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",<br/>\"Statement\": [{<br/>\"Effect\": \"Deny\",<br/>\"Action\": \"ec2:RunInstances\",<br/>\"Resource\": [<br/>\"arn:aws:ec2:region:account:instance/*\"<br/>],<br/>\"Condition\": {<br/>\"StringNotEquals\": {<br/>\"ec2:InstanceType\": [\"t2.micro\", \"t2.small\"]<br/>}<br/>}<br/>},<br/>{<br/>\"Effect\": \"Allow\",<br/>\"Action\": \"ec2:RunInstances\",<br/>\"Resource\": [<br/>\"arn:aws:ec2:region::image/ami-*\",<br/>\"arn:aws:ec2:region:account:network-interface/*\",<br/>\"arn:aws:ec2:region:account:instance/*\",<br/>\"arn:aws:ec2:region:account:subnet/*\",<br/>\"arn:aws:ec2:region:account:volume/*\",<br/>\"arn:aws:ec2:region:account:key-pair/*\",<br/>\"arn:aws:ec2:region:account:security-group/*\"<br/>]<br/>}<br/>]<br/>}<br/>c. Subnet<br/>The following policy allows users to launch instances using only the specified subnet, subnet-12345678. The group can't launch instances into any another subnet<br/>(unless another statement grants the users permission to do so). Users are still able to launch instances into EC2-Classic.<br/>{<br/>\"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",<br/>\"Statement\": [{<br/>\"Effect\": \"Allow\",<br/>\"Action\": \"ec2:RunInstances\",<br/>\"Resource\": [<br/>\"arn:aws:ec2:region:account:subnet/subnet-12345678\",<br/>\"arn:aws:ec2:region:account:network-interface/*\",<br/>\"arn:aws:ec2:region:account:instance/*\",<br/>\"arn:aws:ec2:region:account:volume/*\",<br/>\"arn:aws:ec2:region::image/ami-*\",<br/>\"arn:aws:ec2:region:account:key-pair/*\",<br/>\"arn:aws:ec2:region:account:security-group/*\"<br/>]<br/>}<br/>]<br/>}<br/>Alternatively, you could create a policy that denies users permission to launch an instance into any other subnet.

If you need to use a Condition element with one or more of these resources, you must create multiple statements as shown in this example.The following policy allows users to attach volumes with the tag \"volume_user=iam-user-name\" to instances with the tag \"department=dev\", and to detach those volumes from those instances.

RunInstances requires an AMI and creates an instance; and users can specify a key pair and security group in the request. Launching into EC2-VPC requires a subnet, and creates a network interface. Launching from an Amazon EBS-backed AMI creates a volume. Therefore, the user must have permission to use these Amazon EC2 resources. The caller can also configure the instance using optional parameters toRunInstances, such as the instance type and a subnet. You can create a policy statement that requires users to specify an optional parameter, or restricts users to particular values for a parameter. The examples in this section demonstrate some of the many possible ways that you can control the configuration of an instance that a user can launch.Note that by default, users don't have permission to describe, start, stop, or terminate the resulting instances. One way to grant the users permission to manage the resulting instances is to create a specific tag for each instance, and then create a statement that enables them to manage instances with that tag. For more information, see2: Working with instances.a. AMIThe following policy allows users to launch instances using only the AMIs that have the specified tag, \"department=dev\", associated with them. The users can't launch instances using other AMIs because the Condition element of the first statement requires that users specify an AMI that has this tag. The users also can't launch into a subnet, as the policy does not grant permissions for the subnet and network interface resources. They can, however, launch into EC2-Classic. The second statement uses a wildcard to enable users to create instance resources, and requires users to specify the key pair project_keypair and the security group sg-1a2b3c4d.

The company is expecting 10-15 job requests each day.Which solution meets these requirements?", "Suggested Answer:\nA"], "que_header": "<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 699<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>", "ans": "Suggested Answer:\nA ", "ans_details": "\n"}, {"name": "Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate SAA-C02 topic 1 question 336 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/46411-exam-aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02/", "reply": "9", "views": "1891", "username": "dmscountera", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            Anj08\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 1Â month ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate SAA-C02\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 336<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate SAA-C02 Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"690776\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">A company wants to use high performance computing (HPC) infrastructure on AWS for financial risk modeling.

All requests to the organizationג€™s DC will be routed to the VPN gateway.Here are the valid entries for the main route table in this scenario:Destination: 0.0.0.0/0 & Target: i-12345 (To route all internet traffic to the NAT Instance.Destination: 172.28.0.0/12 & Target: vgw-12345 (To route all the organizationג€™s data center traffic to the VPN gateway).Destination: 20.0.0.0/16 & Target: local (To allow local routing in VPC).\n                                    "}, {"name": "Exam AWS-SysOps topic 1 question 216 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/15873-exam-aws-sysops-topic-1-question-216-discussion/", "reply": "2", "views": "477", "username": "awscertified", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            TroyMcLure\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 1Â month ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-sysops/\">\n                                    AWS-SysOps\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 216<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-sysops/\">\n                                    [All AWS-SysOps Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"704718\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">A sys admin is using server side encryption with AWS S3.

The user is responsible for tracking which encryption key was used for which object's version\n                                    "}, {"name": "Exam AWS-SysOps topic 1 question 211 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/10917-exam-aws-sysops-topic-1-question-211-discussion/", "reply": "3", "views": "819", "username": "karmaah", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            TroyMcLure\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 1Â month ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-sysops/\">\n                                    AWS-SysOps\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 211<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-sysops/\">\n                                    [All AWS-SysOps Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"704713\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">A user has setup a custom application which generates a number in decimals.

It can handle millions of requests per second. After the load balancer receives a connection request, it selects a target from the target group for the default rule. It attempts to open a TCP connection to the selected target on the port specified in the listener configuration.<br/>When you enable an Availability Zone for the load balancer, Elastic Load Balancing creates a load balancer node in the Availability Zone. By default, each load balancer node distributes traffic across the registered targets in its Availability Zone only. If you enable cross-zone load balancing, each load balancer node distributes traffic across the registered targets in all enabled Availability Zones. For more information, see Availability Zones.<br/>If you enable multiple Availability Zones for your load balancer and ensure that each target group has at least one target in each enabled Availability Zone, this increases the fault tolerance of your applications. For example, if one or more target groups does not have a healthy target in an Availability Zone, we remove the<br/>IP address for the corresponding subnet from DNS, but the load balancer nodes in the other Availability Zones are still available to route traffic. If a client doesn't honor the time-to-live (TTL) and sends requests to the IP address after it is removed from DNS, the requests fail.<br/>For TCP traffic, the load balancer selects a target using a flow hash algorithm based on the protocol, source IP address, source port, destination IP address, destination port, and TCP sequence number. The TCP connections from a client have different source ports and sequence numbers, and can be routed to different targets. Each individual TCP connection is routed to a single target for the life of the connection.<br/>For UDP traffic, the load balancer selects a target using a flow hash algorithm based on the protocol, source IP address, source port, destination IP address, and destination port. A UDP flow has the same source and destination, so it is consistently routed to a single target throughout its lifetime. Different UDP flows have different source IP addresses and ports, so they can be routed to different targets.<br/>An Auto Scaling group contains a collection of Amazon EC2 instances that are treated as a logical grouping for the purposes of automatic scaling and management. An Auto Scaling group also enables you to use Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling features such as health check replacements and scaling policies. Both maintaining the number of instances in an Auto Scaling group and automatic scaling are the core functionality of the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling service.<br/>The size of an Auto Scaling group depends on the number of instances that you set as the desired capacity. You can adjust its size to meet demand, either manually or by using automatic scaling.<br/>An Auto Scaling group starts by launching enough instances to meet its desired capacity. It maintains this number of instances by performing periodic health checks on the instances in the group. The Auto Scaling group continues to maintain a fixed number of instances even if an instance becomes unhealthy. If an instance becomes unhealthy, the group terminates the unhealthy instance and launches another instance to replace it.<br/>Reference:<br/>https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/introduction.html https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/AutoScalingGroup.html\n                                    </span>\n</p>\n</div>\n<!-- / Question  -->\n<div class=\"discussion-meta-data mt-3 pt-1 border-top\">\n                                    by\n                                    \n                                    <a class=\"title-username\" href=\"/user/malefin280/\" style=\"\">\n<i class=\"fa fa-user-o\"></i>\n                                        malefin280\n                                    </a>\n                                    \n                                    at <i>\n                                    June 1, 2020, 6:19 p.m.</i>\n</div>\n</div>", "que": ["A gaming company has multiple Amazon EC2 instances in a single Availability Zone for its multiplayer game that communicates with users on Layer 4.

Combining Read Replicas with Multi-AZ enables you to build a resilient disaster recovery strategy and simplify your database engine upgrade process.<br/>Amazon RDS Read Replicas enable you to create one or more read-only copies of your database instance within the same AWS Region or in a different AWS<br/>Region. Updates made to the source database are then asynchronously copied to your Read Replicas. In addition to providing scalability for read-heavy workloads, Read Replicas can be promoted to become a standalone database instance when needed.<br/>Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployments provide enhanced availability for database instances within a single AWS Region. With Multi-AZ, your data is synchronously replicated to a standby in a different Availability Zone (AZ). In the event of an infrastructure failure, Amazon RDS performs an automatic failover to the standby, minimizing disruption to your applications.<br/>You can now use Read Replicas with Multi-AZ as part of a disaster recovery (DR) strategy for your production databases. A well-designed and tested DR plan is critical for maintaining business continuity after a disaster. A Read Replica in a different region than the source database can be used as a standby database and promoted to become the new production database in case of a regional disruption.<br/>You can also combine Read Replicas with Multi-AZ for your database engine upgrade process. You can create a Read Replica of your production database instance and upgrade it to a new database engine version. When the upgrade is complete, you can stop applications, promote the Read Replica to a standalone database instance, and switch over your applications. Since the database instance is already a Multi-AZ deployment, no additional steps are needed.<br/>Overview of Amazon RDS Read Replicas<br/>Deploying one or more read replicas for a given source DB instance might make sense in a variety of scenarios, including the following:<br/>Scaling beyond the compute or I/O capacity of a single DB instance for read-heavy database workloads. You can direct this excess read traffic to one or more read replicas.<br/>Serving read traffic while the source DB instance is unavailable. In some cases, your source DB instance might not be able to take I/O requests, for example due to I/O suspension for backups or scheduled maintenance. In these cases, you can direct read traffic to your read replicas.
