Consider the following scenarios: Unlimited memory, unlimited kernel memory: This is the default behavior. Unlimited memory, limited kernel memory: This is appropriate when the amount of memory needed by all cgroups is greater than the amount of memory that actually exists on the host machine. You can configure the kernel memory to never go over what is available on the host machine, and containers which need more memory need to wait for it. Limited memory, umlimited kernel memory: The overall memory is limited, but the kernel memory is not. Limited memory, limited kernel memory: Limiting both user and kernel memory can be useful for debugging memory-related problems. If a container is using an unexpected amount of either type of memory, it will run out of memory without affecting other containers or the host machine. Within this setting, if the kernel memory limit is lower than the user memory limit, running out of kernel memory will cause the container to experience an OOM error.

For example, you might not want users to have direct access to your stack's app servers or databases and instead require that all public traffic be channeled through an Elastic Load Balancer. A VPC consists of one or more subnets, each of which contains one or more instances. Each subnet has an associated routing table that directs outbound traffic based on its destination IP address.

AWS OpsWorks requires the VPC to be configured so that every instance in the stack, including instances in private subnets, has access to the following endpoints:The AWS OpsWorks service,https://opsworks-instance-service.us-east-1.amazonaws.com.Amazon S3 -The package repositories for Amazon Linux or Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, depending on which operating system you specify.Your app and custom cookbook repositories.Reference:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/workingstacks-vpc.html#workingstacks-vpc-basics\n                                    "}, {"name": "Exam AWS Certified Security - Specialty topic 1 question 219 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/47136-exam-aws-certified-security-specialty-topic-1-question-219/", "reply": "7", "views": "471", "username": "kk3322", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            AppSecurity\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 3Â weeks, 3Â days ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-security-specialty/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Security - Specialty\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 219<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-security-specialty/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Security - Specialty Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"674234\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">A companyג€™s director of information security wants a daily email report from AWS that contains recommendations for each company account to meet AWS<br/>Security best practices.<br/>Which solution would meet these requirements?<br/></p>\n<div class=\"question-choices-container\">\n<ul>\n<li class=\"multi-choice-item\">\n<span class=\"multi-choice-letter\">\n                                                        A.\n                                                    </span>\n                                                    \n                                                    In every AWS account, configure AWS Lambda to query the AWS Support API for AWS Trusted Advisor security checks.

However, the user must create the EBS in the same zone as the instance so that it can attach the EBS volume to the running instance.Reference:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Subnets.html#VPCSubnet\n                                    "}, {"name": "Exam AWS Certified Machine Learning - Specialty topic 1 question 131 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/44155-exam-aws-certified-machine-learning-specialty-topic-1/", "reply": "9", "views": "469", "username": "jiadong", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            btsql\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 3Â weeks, 3Â days ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-machine-learning-specialty/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Machine Learning - Specialty\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 131<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-machine-learning-specialty/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Machine Learning - Specialty Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"633041\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">A financial services company wants to adopt Amazon SageMaker as its default data science environment.

across all users in an AWS account. This process should evaluate the permissions currently granted to each user by examining the userג€™s attached IAM access policies compared to the permissions the user has actually used in the past 90 days. Any differences in the comparison would indicate that the user has more permissions than are required. A report of the deltas should be sent to the Information Security team for further review and IAM user access policy revisions, as required.<br/>Which solution is fully automated and will produce the MOST detailed deltas report?<br/></p>\n<div class=\"question-choices-container\">\n<ul>\n<li class=\"multi-choice-item\">\n<span class=\"multi-choice-letter\">\n                                                        A.\n                                                    </span>\n                                                    \n                                                    Create an AWS Lambda function that calls the IAM Access Advisor API to pull service permissions granted on a user-by-user basis for all users in the AWS account. Ensure that Access Advisor is configured with a tracking period of 90 days. Invoke the Lambda function using an Amazon CloudWatch Events rule on a weekly schedule. For each record, by user, by service, if the Access Advisor Last Accesses field indicates a day count instead of ג€Not accesses in the tracking period,ג€ this indicates a delta compared to what is in the userג€™s currently attached access polices. After Lambda has iterated through all users in the AWS account, configure it to generate a report and send the report using Amazon SES.\n                                                </li>\n<li class=\"multi-choice-item correct-hidden\">\n<span class=\"multi-choice-letter\">\n                                                        B.\n                                                    </span>\n                                                    \n                                                    Configure an AWS CloudTrail trail that spans all AWS Regions and all read/write events, and point this trail to an Amazon S3 bucket. Create Amazon Athena table and specify the S3 bucket ARN in the CREATE TABLE query. Create an AWS Lambda function that accesses the Athena table using the SDK, which performs a SELECT, ensuring that the WHERE clause includes userIdentity, eventName, and eventTime.  Compare the results against the userג€™s currently attached IAM access policies to determine any deltas. Configure an Amazon CloudWatch Events schedule to automate this process to run once a week. Configure Amazon SES to send a consolidated report to the Information Security team.\n                                                </li>\n<li class=\"multi-choice-item\">\n<span class=\"multi-choice-letter\">\n                                                        C.\n                                                    </span>\n                                                    \n                                                    Configure VPC Flow Logs on all subnets across all VPCs in all regions to capture user traffic across the entire account. Ensure that all logs are being sent to a centralized Amazon S3 bucket, so all flow logs can be consolidated and aggregated. Create an AWS Lambda function that is triggered once a week by an Amazon CloudWatch Events schedule. Ensure that the Lambda function parses the flow log files for the following information: IAM user ID, subnet ID, VPC ID, Allow/Reject status per API call, and service name. Then have the function determine the deltas on a user-by-user basis. Configure the Lambda function to send the consolidated report using Amazon SES.\n                                                </li>\n<li class=\"multi-choice-item\">\n<span class=\"multi-choice-letter\">\n                                                        D.\n                                                    </span>\n                                                    \n                                                    Create an Amazon ES cluster and note its endpoint URL, which will be provided as an environment variable into a Lambda function. Configure an Amazon S3 event on a AWS CloudTrail trail destination S3 bucket and ensure that the event is configured to send to a Lambda function. Create the Lambda function to consume the events, parse the input from JSON, and transform it to an Amazon ES document format. POST the documents to the Amazon ES clusterג€™s endpoint by way of the passed-in environment variable. Make sure that the proper indexing exists in Amazon ES and use Apache Lucene queries to parse the permissions on a user-by-user basis. Export the deltas into a report and have Amazon ES send the reports to the Information Security team using Amazon SES every week.\n                                                </li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<a class=\"btn btn-primary reveal-solution\" href=\"#\">Show Suggested Answer</a>\n<a class=\"btn btn-primary hide-solution d-none\" href=\"#\">Hide Answer</a>\n<p class=\"card-text question-answer bg-light white-text\">\n<span class=\"correct-answer-box\"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong>\n<span class=\"correct-answer\">B</span> <br/></span>\n<span class=\"answer-description\">\n</span>\n</p>\n</div>\n<!-- / Question  -->\n<div class=\"discussion-meta-data mt-3 pt-1 border-top\">\n                                    by\n                                    \n                                    <a class=\"title-username\" href=\"/user/BeastX/\" style=\"\">\n<i class=\"fa fa-user-o\"></i>\n                                        BeastX\n                                    </a>\n                                    \n                                    at <i>\n                                    Nov. 19, 2019, 1:32 p.m.</i>\n</div>\n</div>", "que": ["A DevOps Engineer must automate a weekly process of identifying unnecessary permissions on a per-user basis, across all users in an AWS account.

In this scenario the organization should plan appropriate tools to take a backup, plan the retention policy for data and setup security of the data.Reference:http://d36cz9buwru1tt.cloudfront.net/AWS_Disaster_Recovery.pdf\n                                    "}, {"name": "Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional topic 1 question 164 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/53315-exam-aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional-topic-1/", "reply": "3", "views": "73", "username": "viet1991", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            01037\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 3Â weeks, 3Â days ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 164<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"674867\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">An organization is having an application which can start and stop an EC2 instance as per schedule.

The user has complete control over the virtual networking environment. Within this virtual private cloud, the user can launch AWS resources, such as an ELB, and EC2 instances. There are two ELBs available with VPC: internet facing and internal (private) ELB. For the internet facing ELB it is required that theELB should be in a public subnet. After the user creates the public subnet, he should ensure to associate the route table of the public subnet with the internet gateway to enable the load balancer in the subnet to connect with the internet.

The release accidentally deleted thousands of rows from an important table and broke some application functionality.<br/>This was discovered 4 hours after the release. Upon investigation, a Database Specialist tracked the issue to a DELETE command in the script with an incorrect<br/>WHERE clause filtering the wrong set of rows.<br/>The Aurora DB cluster has Backtrack enabled with an 8-hour backtrack window.

You cannot copy a certificate between regions.Reference:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-regions.html\n                                    "}, {"name": "Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate SAA-C02 topic 1 question 293 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/43792-exam-aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02/", "reply": "31", "views": "3352", "username": "toto059", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            abc123_123\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 4Â weeks ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate SAA-C02\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 293<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate SAA-C02 Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"690733\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">A company owns an asynchronous API that is used to ingest user requests and, based on the request type, dispatch requests to the appropriate microservice for processing.
