I find your scenarios very fuzzy, since you can obviously mix-n-match between them. I think you should decide by layers instead:<br/>Load Balancer Layer: ELB or just DNS, or roll-your-own. (Using DNS+EIPs is slightly cheaper, but less reliable than ELB.)<br/>Storage Layer for 17TB of Images: This is the perfect use case for S3. Off-load all the web requests directly to the relevant JPEGs in S3. Your EC2 boxes just generate links to them.<br/>If your app already serves it's own images (not links to images), you might start with EFS. But more than likely, you can just setup a web server to re-write or re- direct all JPEG links to S3 pretty easily.<br/>If you use S3, don't serve directly from the bucket - Serve via a CNAME in domain you control. That way, you can switch in CloudFront easily.<br/>EBS will be way more expensive, and you'll need 2x the drives if you need 2 boxes. Yuck.<br/>Consider a smaller storage format. For example, JPEG200 or WebP or other tools might make for smaller images. There is also the DejaVu format from a while back.<br/>Cache Layer: Adding CloudFront in front of S3 will help people on the other side of the world -- well, possibly. Typical archives follow a power law. The long tail of requests means that most JPEGs won't be requested enough to be in the cache. So you are only speeding up the most popular objects. You can always wait, and switch in CF later after you know your costs better. (In some cases, it can actually lower costs.)<br/>You can also put CloudFront in front of your app, since your archive search results should be fairly static. This will also allow you to run with a smaller instance type, since CF will handle much of the load if you do it right.<br/>Database Layer: A few options:<br/>Use whatever your current server does for now, and replace with something else down the road. Don't under-estimate this approach, sometimes it's better to start now and optimize later.<br/><br/>Use RDS to run MySQL/Postgres -<br/>I'm not as familiar with ElasticSearch / Cloudsearch, but obviously Cloudsearch will be less maintenance+setup.<br/>App Layer:<br/>When creating the app layer from scratch, consider CloudFormation and/or OpsWorks. It's extra stuff to learn, but helps down the road.<br/>Java+Tomcat is right up the alley of ElasticBeanstalk. (Basically EC2 + Autoscale + ELB).<br/>Preventing Abuse: When you put something in a public S3 bucket, people will hot-link it from their web pages. If you want to prevent that, your app on the EC2 box can generate signed links to S3 that expire in a few hours. Now everyone will be forced to go thru the app, and the app can apply rate limiting, etc.<br/>Saving money: If you don't mind having downtime:<br/>run everything in one AZ (both DBs and EC2s). You can always add servers and AZs down the road, as long as it's architected to be stateless. In fact, you should use multiple regions if you want it to be really robust. use Reduced Redundancy in S3 to save a few hundred bucks per month (Someone will have to \"go fix it\" every time it breaks, including having an off-line copy to repair S3.)<br/>Buy Reserved Instances on your EC2 boxes to make them cheaper. (Start with the RI market and buy a partially used one to get started.) It's just a coupon saying<br/>\"if you run this type of box in this AZ, you will save on the per-hour costs.\" You can get 1/2 to 1/3 off easily.<br/>Rewrite the application to use less memory and CPU - that way you can run on fewer/smaller boxes. (May or may not be worth the investment.)<br/>If your app will be used very infrequently, you will save a lot of money by using Lambda. I'd be worried that it would be quite slow if you tried to run a Java application on it though.<br/>We're missing some information like load, latency expectations from search, indexing speed, size of the search index, etc. But with what you've given us, I would go with S3 as the storage for the files (S3 rocks. It is really, really awesome). If you're stuck with the commercial search application, then on EC2 instances with autoscaling and an ELB. If you are allowed an alternative search engine, Elasticsearch is probably your best bet. I'd run it on EC2 instead of the AWS<br/>Elasticsearch service, as IMHO it's not ready yet. Don't autoscale Elasticsearch automatically though, it'll cause all sorts of issues. I have zero experience with<br/>CloudSearch so ic an't comment on that. Regardless of which option, I'd use CloudFormation for all of it.\n                                    </span>\n</p>\n</div>\n<!-- / Question  -->\n<div class=\"discussion-meta-data mt-3 pt-1 border-top\">\n                                    by\n                                    \n                                    <a class=\"title-username\" href=\"/user/Tamili/\" style=\"\">\n<i class=\"fa fa-user-o\"></i>\n                                        Tamili\n                                    </a>\n                                    \n                                    at <i>\n                                    Nov. 15, 2019, 1:40 a.m.</i>\n</div>\n</div>", "que": ["A newspaper organization has an on-premises application which allows the public to search its back catalogue and retrieve individual newspaper pages via a website written in Java.

There is also the DejaVu format from a while back.Cache Layer: Adding CloudFront in front of S3 will help people on the other side of the world -- well, possibly. Typical archives follow a power law. The long tail of requests means that most JPEGs won't be requested enough to be in the cache. So you are only speeding up the most popular objects. You can always wait, and switch in CF later after you know your costs better. (In some cases, it can actually lower costs.)You can also put CloudFront in front of your app, since your archive search results should be fairly static. This will also allow you to run with a smaller instance type, since CF will handle much of the load if you do it right.Database Layer: A few options:Use whatever your current server does for now, and replace with something else down the road. Don't under-estimate this approach, sometimes it's better to start now and optimize later.Use RDS to run MySQL/Postgres -I'm not as familiar with ElasticSearch / Cloudsearch, but obviously Cloudsearch will be less maintenance+setup.App Layer:When creating the app layer from scratch, consider CloudFormation and/or OpsWorks. It's extra stuff to learn, but helps down the road.Java+Tomcat is right up the alley of ElasticBeanstalk. (Basically EC2 + Autoscale + ELB).Preventing Abuse: When you put something in a public S3 bucket, people will hot-link it from their web pages. If you want to prevent that, your app on the EC2 box can generate signed links to S3 that expire in a few hours. Now everyone will be forced to go thru the app, and the app can apply rate limiting, etc.Saving money: If you don't mind having downtime:run everything in one AZ (both DBs and EC2s). You can always add servers and AZs down the road, as long as it's architected to be stateless. In fact, you should use multiple regions if you want it to be really robust. use Reduced Redundancy in S3 to save a few hundred bucks per month (Someone will have to \"go fix it\" every time it breaks, including having an off-line copy to repair S3.)Buy Reserved Instances on your EC2 boxes to make them cheaper. (Start with the RI market and buy a partially used one to get started.) It's just a coupon saying\"if you run this type of box in this AZ, you will save on the per-hour costs.\" You can get 1/2 to 1/3 off easily.Rewrite the application to use less memory and CPU - that way you can run on fewer/smaller boxes. (May or may not be worth the investment.)If your app will be used very infrequently, you will save a lot of money by using Lambda. I'd be worried that it would be quite slow if you tried to run a Java application on it though.We're missing some information like load, latency expectations from search, indexing speed, size of the search index, etc. But with what you've given us, I would go with S3 as the storage for the files (S3 rocks. It is really, really awesome). If you're stuck with the commercial search application, then on EC2 instances with autoscaling and an ELB. If you are allowed an alternative search engine, Elasticsearch is probably your best bet. I'd run it on EC2 instead of the AWSElasticsearch service, as IMHO it's not ready yet. Don't autoscale Elasticsearch automatically though, it'll cause all sorts of issues. I have zero experience withCloudSearch so ic an't comment on that.

But more than likely, you can just setup a web server to re-write or re- direct all JPEG links to S3 pretty easily.If you use S3, don't serve directly from the bucket - Serve via a CNAME in domain you control.

Workers then use Amazon Simple Email Service to send messages to your on call teams.\n                                                </li>\n<li class=\"multi-choice-item\">\n<span class=\"multi-choice-letter\">\n                                                        B.\n                                                    </span>\n                                                    \n                                                    Create an Amazon SNS topic and configure your on-call team email addresses as subscribers.

Trigger the Lambda function to create a cross-region snapshot copy when the SNS topic for backup events receives a new message. Configure the Lambda function to restore an instance from a snapshot to trigger sending new messages published to the availability SNS topic.\n                                                </li>\n<li class=\"multi-choice-item\">\n<span class=\"multi-choice-letter\">\n                                                        C.\n                                                    </span>\n                                                    \n                                                    Create a scheduled Amazon CloudWatch Events rule to make a call to Amazon RDS to create a snapshot from a database instance and specify a frequency to match the RPO. Create an AWS Step Functions task to call Amazon RDS to perform a cross-region snapshot copy into the failover region, and configure the state machine to execute the task when the RDS snapshot create state is complete. Create an SNS topic subscribed to RDS availability events, and push these messages to an Amazon SQS queue located in the failover region.

Each business unit has multiple AWS accounts for different purposes. The CIO of the company sees that each business unit has data that would be useful to share with other parts of the company. In total, there are about 10 PB of data that needs to be shared with users in<br/>1,000 AWS accounts. The data is proprietary, so some of it should only be available to users with specific job types. Some of the data is used for throughput of intensive workloads, such as simulations. The number of accounts changes frequently because of new initiatives, acquisitions, and divestitures.<br/>A Solutions Architect has been asked to design a system that will allow for sharing data for use in AWS with all of the employees in the company.<br/>Which approach will allow for secure data sharing in scalable way?<br/></p>\n<div class=\"question-choices-container\">\n<ul>\n<li class=\"multi-choice-item\">\n<span class=\"multi-choice-letter\">\n                                                        A.\n                                                    </span>\n                                                    \n                                                    Store the data in a single Amazon S3 bucket. Create an IAM role for every combination of job type and business unit that allows for appropriate read/write access based on object prefixes in the S3 bucket. The roles should have trust policies that allow the business unitג€™s AWS accounts to assume their roles. Use IAM in each business unitג€™s AWS account to prevent them from assuming roles for a different job type.

In most apps, you have hot spots of data that are regularly queried, but only updated periodically. Think of the front page of a blog or news site, or the top 100 leaderboard in an online game. In this type of case, your app can receive dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of requests for the same data before it's updated again. Having your caching layer handle these queries has several advantages. First, it's considerably cheaper to add an in-memory cache than to scale up to a larger database cluster. Second, an in-memory cache is also easier to scale out, because it's easier to distribute an in-memory cache horizontally than a relational database.<br/>Last, a caching layer provides a request buffer in the event of a sudden spike in usage. If your app or game ends up on the front page of Reddit or the App Store, it's not unheard of to see a spike that is 10 to 100 times your normal application load. Even if you autoscale your application instances, a 10x request spike will likely make your database very unhappy.<br/>Let's focus on ElastiCache for Memcached first, because it is the best fit for a cachingfocused solution. We'll revisit Redis later in the paper, and weigh its advantages and disadvantages.<br/>Architecture with ElastiCache for Memcached -<br/>When you deploy an ElastiCache Memcached cluster, it sits in your application as a separate tier alongside your database. As mentioned previously, Amazon<br/>ElastiCache does not directly communicate with your database tier, or indeed have any particular knowledge of your database. A simplified deployment for a web application looks something like this:<br/><img class=\"in-exam-image\" src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/03759/0001000001.jpg\"/><br/>In this architecture diagram, the Amazon EC2 application instances are in an Auto Scaling group, located behind a load balancer using Elastic Load Balancing, which distributes requests among the instances. As requests come into a given EC2 instance, that EC2 instance is responsible for communicating with<br/>ElastiCache and the database tier. For development purposes, you can begin with a single ElastiCache node to test your application, and then scale to additional cluster nodes by modifying the ElastiCache cluster. As you add additional cache nodes, the EC2 application instances are able to distribute cache keys across multiple ElastiCache nodes. The most common practice is to use client-side sharding to distribute keys across cache nodes, which we will discuss later in this paper.<br/><img class=\"in-exam-image\" src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/03759/0001200001.jpg\"/><br/>When you launch an ElastiCache cluster, you can choose the Availability Zone(s) that the cluster lives in. For best performance, you should configure your cluster to use the same Availability Zones as your application servers. To launch an ElastiCache cluster in a specific Availability Zone, make sure to specify the Preferred<br/>Zone(s) option during cache cluster creation. The Availability Zones that you specify will be where ElastiCache will launch your cache nodes. We recommend that you select Spread Nodes Across Zones, which tells ElastiCache to distribute cache nodes across these zones as evenly as possible. This distribution will mitigate the impact of an Availability Zone disruption on your ElastiCache nodes. The trade-off is that some of the requests from your application to ElastiCache will go to a node in a different Availability Zone, meaning latency will be slightly higher. For more details, refer to Creating a Cache Cluster in the Amazon ElastiCache User<br/>Guide.<br/>As mentioned at the outset, ElastiCache can be coupled with a wide variety of databases. Here is an example architecture that uses Amazon DynamoDB instead of Amazon RDS and MySQL:<br/><img class=\"in-exam-image\" src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/03759/0001400001.jpg\"/><br/>This combination of DynamoDB and ElastiCache is very popular with mobile and game companies, because DynamoDB allows for higher write throughput at lower cost than traditional relational databases. In addition, DynamoDB uses a key-value access pattern similar to ElastiCache, which also simplifies the programming model. Instead of using relational SQL for the primary database but then key-value patterns for the cache, both the primary database and cache can be programmed similarly. In this architecture pattern, DynamoDB remains the source of truth for data, but application reads are offloaded to ElastiCache for a speed boost.\n                                    </span>\n</p>\n</div>\n<!-- / Question  -->\n<div class=\"discussion-meta-data mt-3 pt-1 border-top\">\n                                    by\n                                    \n                                    <a class=\"title-username\" href=\"/user/ExtHo/\" style=\"\">\n<i class=\"fa fa-user-o\"></i>\n                                        ExtHo\n                                    </a>\n                                    \n                                    at <i>\n                                    March 16, 2021, 7:14 p.m.</i>\n</div>\n</div>", "que": ["Your application is using an ELB in front of an Auto Scaling group of web/application servers deployed across two AZs and a Multi-AZ RDS Instance for data persistence.The database CPU is often above 80% usage and 90% of I/O operations on the database are reads.

As mentioned previously, AmazonElastiCache does not directly communicate with your database tier, or indeed have any particular knowledge of your database. A simplified deployment for a web application looks something like this:In this architecture diagram, the Amazon EC2 application instances are in an Auto Scaling group, located behind a load balancer using Elastic Load Balancing, which distributes requests among the instances. As requests come into a given EC2 instance, that EC2 instance is responsible for communicating withElastiCache and the database tier. For development purposes, you can begin with a single ElastiCache node to test your application, and then scale to additional cluster nodes by modifying the ElastiCache cluster. As you add additional cache nodes, the EC2 application instances are able to distribute cache keys across multiple ElastiCache nodes. The most common practice is to use client-side sharding to distribute keys across cache nodes, which we will discuss later in this paper.When you launch an ElastiCache cluster, you can choose the Availability Zone(s) that the cluster lives in. For best performance, you should configure your cluster to use the same Availability Zones as your application servers. To launch an ElastiCache cluster in a specific Availability Zone, make sure to specify the PreferredZone(s) option during cache cluster creation. The Availability Zones that you specify will be where ElastiCache will launch your cache nodes. We recommend that you select Spread Nodes Across Zones, which tells ElastiCache to distribute cache nodes across these zones as evenly as possible. This distribution will mitigate the impact of an Availability Zone disruption on your ElastiCache nodes. The trade-off is that some of the requests from your application to ElastiCache will go to a node in a different Availability Zone, meaning latency will be slightly higher. For more details, refer to Creating a Cache Cluster in the Amazon ElastiCache UserGuide.As mentioned at the outset, ElastiCache can be coupled with a wide variety of databases. Here is an example architecture that uses Amazon DynamoDB instead of Amazon RDS and MySQL:This combination of DynamoDB and ElastiCache is very popular with mobile and game companies, because DynamoDB allows for higher write throughput at lower cost than traditional relational databases. In addition, DynamoDB uses a key-value access pattern similar to ElastiCache, which also simplifies the programming model. Instead of using relational SQL for the primary database but then key-value patterns for the cache, both the primary database and cache can be programmed similarly. In this architecture pattern, DynamoDB remains the source of truth for data, but application reads are offloaded to ElastiCache for a speed boost.\n                                    "}, {"name": "Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional topic 1 question 80 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/21692-exam-aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional-topic-1/", "reply": "3", "views": "1131", "username": "oatif", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            cldy\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 2Â months, 3Â weeks ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 80<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"674783\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">Dave is the main administrator in Example Corp., and he decides to use paths to help delineate the users in the company and set up a separate administrator group for each path-based division.

For the most demanding workloads, Amazon EFS can support performance over 10 GB/sec and up to 500,000 IOPS.\n                                    "}, {"name": "Exam AWS-SysOps topic 1 question 593 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/5276-exam-aws-sysops-topic-1-question-593-discussion/", "reply": "18", "views": "2710", "username": "coolboylqy", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            intp75\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 3Â months ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-sysops/\">\n                                    AWS-SysOps\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 593<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-sysops/\">\n                                    [All AWS-SysOps Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"705095\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">An organization is running multiple applications for their customers.

Even though many factory locations do not have reliable or high- speed internet connectivity, the manufacturer would like to maintain near-real-time inference capabilities.Which deployment architecture for the model will address these business requirements?", "Suggested Answer:\nA"], "que_header": "<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-machine-learning-specialty/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Machine Learning - Specialty\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 112<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-machine-learning-specialty/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Machine Learning - Specialty Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>", "ans": "Suggested Answer:\nA ", "ans_details": "\n"}, {"name": "Exam AWS Certified Machine Learning - Specialty topic 1 question 99 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/43873-exam-aws-certified-machine-learning-specialty-topic-1/", "reply": "3", "views": "494", "username": "joep21", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            Vita_Rasta84444\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 3Â months ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-machine-learning-specialty/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Machine Learning - Specialty\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 99<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-machine-learning-specialty/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Machine Learning - Specialty Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"633009\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">A company uses camera images of the tops of items displayed on store shelves to determine which items were removed and which ones still remain.

Amazon EC2 instances running in multiple Availability Zones within the same AWS Region can access the file system, so that many users can access and share a common data source.How Amazon EFS Works with Amazon EC2Reference:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/how-it-works.html#how-it-works-ec2\n                                    "}, {"name": "Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate SAA-C02 topic 1 question 49 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/21829-exam-aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02/", "reply": "33", "views": "11853", "username": "malefin280", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            Flass\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 3Â months ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02/\">\n                                    AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate SAA-C02\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 49<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate SAA-C02 Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"690489\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">A security team to limit access to specific services or actions in all of the teamג€™s AWS accounts.

You can create multiple OUs within a single organization, and you can create OUs within other OUs to form a hierarchical structure.

AMI Copy helps enable several key scenarios including:Simple and Consistent Multi-Region Deployment ג€\" You can copy an AMI from one region to another, enabling you to easily launch consistent instances based on the same AMI into different regions.Scalability ג€\" You can more easily design and build world-scale applications that meet the needs of your users, regardless of their location.Performance ג€\" You can increase performance by distributing your application and locating critical components of your application in closer proximity to your users.You can also take advantage of region-specific features such as instance types or other AWS services.Even Higher Availability ג€\" You can design and deploy applications across AWS regions, to increase availability.Once the new AMI is in an Available state the copy is complete.Reference:https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/ec2-ami-copy-between-regions/\n                                    "}, {"name": "Exam AWS DevOps Engineer Professional topic 1 question 47 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/46841-exam-aws-devops-engineer-professional-topic-1-question-47/", "reply": "4", "views": "391", "username": "Rajarshi", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            aws_Tamilan\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 3Â months ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-devops-engineer-professional/\">\n                                    AWS DevOps Engineer Professional\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 47<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-devops-engineer-professional/\">\n                                    [All AWS DevOps Engineer Professional Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"675500\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">A DevOps Engineer is building a continuous deployment pipeline for a serverless application using AWS CodePipeline and AWS CodeBuild.
