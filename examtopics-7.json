In addition to monitoring the built-in metrics that come with AWS, you can monitor your own custom metrics.With CloudWatch, you gain system-wide visibility into resource utilization, application perfor-mance, and operational health.Reference:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/WhatIsCloudWatch.html\n                                    "}, {"name": "Exam ANS-C00 topic 1 question 278 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/47499-exam-ans-c00-topic-1-question-278-discussion/", "reply": "4", "views": "108", "username": "eeghai7thioyaiR4", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            jithin1234\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 4Â weeks, 1Â day ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/ans-c00/\">\n                                    ANS-C00\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 278<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/ans-c00/\">\n                                    [All ANS-C00 Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"603115\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">In AWS Direct Connect, to provide for failover, AWS recommends that you request and configure two dedicated connections to AWS.

Using AWS Direct Connect, you can establish private connectivity between AWS and your datacenter, office, or collocation environment, which in many cases can reduce your network costs, increase bandwidth throughput, and provide a more consistent network experience than Internet-based connections.<br/>AWS Direct Connect lets you establish a dedicated network connection between your network and one of the AWS Direct Connect locations. Using industry standard 802.1q VLANs, this dedicated connection can be partitioned into multiple virtual interfaces. This allows you to use the same connection to access public resources such as objects stored in Amazon S3 using public IP address space, and private resources such as Amazon EC2 instances running within an<br/><br/>Amazon -<br/>Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)<br/>using private IP space, while maintaining network separation between the public and private environments. Virtual interfaces can be reconfigured at any time to meet your changing needs.<br/>What is AWS Direct Connect?<br/>AWS Direct Connect links your internal network to an AWS Direct Connect location over a standard 1 gigabit or 10 gigabit Ethernet fiber-optic cable. One end of the cable is connected to your router, the other to an AWS Direct Connect router. With this connection in place, you can create virtual interfaces directly to the<br/>AWS cloud (for example, to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and to Amazon Virtual Private<br/>Cloud (Amazon VPC), bypassing Internet service providers in your network path. An AWS Direct Connect location provides access to Amazon Web Services in the region it is associated with, as well as access to other US regions. For example, you can provision a single connection to any AWS Direct Connect location in the US and use it to access public AWS services in all US Regions and AWS GovCloud (US).<br/>The following diagram shows how AWS Direct Connect interfaces with your network.<br/><img class=\"in-exam-image\" src=\"/assets/media/exam-media/03759/0003600001.png\"/><br/><br/>Requirements -<br/>To use AWS Direct Connect, your network must meet one of the following conditions:<br/>Your network is collocated with an existing AWS Direct Connect location.

D is wrong because to allow outgoing traffic to the Git repository requires an outgoing security group rule.\n                                    "}, {"name": "Exam AWS Certified SysOps Administrator - Associate topic 1 question 1 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/49252-exam-aws-certified-sysops-administrator-associate-topic-1/", "reply": "9", "views": "786", "username": "Abobakr", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            RicardoD\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 1Â month ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-sysops-administrator-associate/\">\n                                    AWS Certified SysOps Administrator - Associate\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 1<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-certified-sysops-administrator-associate/\">\n                                    [All AWS Certified SysOps Administrator - Associate Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"657305\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">A SysOps administrator is creating two AWS CloudFormation templates.

This proxy server will attach an IAM role to the user after authentication.\n                                    "}, {"name": "Exam AWS-SysOps topic 1 question 300 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/16342-exam-aws-sysops-topic-1-question-300-discussion/", "reply": "7", "views": "535", "username": "awscertified", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            TroyMcLure\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 1Â month ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-sysops/\">\n                                    AWS-SysOps\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 300<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-sysops/\">\n                                    [All AWS-SysOps Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"704802\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">A user has created an EBS volume of 10 GB and attached it to a running instance.

The steps are:Create a new Launch config with detailed monitoring enabledUpdate the Auto Scaling group with a new launch configEnable detail monitoring on each EC2 instance\n                                    "}, {"name": "Exam AWS-SysOps topic 1 question 296 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/16340-exam-aws-sysops-topic-1-question-296-discussion/", "reply": "2", "views": "381", "username": "awscertified", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            TroyMcLure\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 1Â month ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-sysops/\">\n                                    AWS-SysOps\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 296<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-sysops/\">\n                                    [All AWS-SysOps Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"704798\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">A user has launched an EC2 instance and deployed a production application in it.

However, it will not add running instances that were launched while the process was suspended; those instances must be added manually.\n                                    "}, {"name": "Exam AWS-SysOps topic 1 question 284 discussion", "url": "/discussions/amazon/view/16334-exam-aws-sysops-topic-1-question-284-discussion/", "reply": "2", "views": "277", "username": "awscertified", "posttime": "Last post by\n                                    \n\n                                            TroyMcLure\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                        Made 1Â month ago", "queanshtml": "<div class=\"discussion-header-container\">\n<!-- Question -->\n<div class=\"question-discussion-header\">\n                                Actual exam question from\n                                Amazon's\n                                <a class=\"discussion-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-sysops/\">\n                                    AWS-SysOps\n                                </a>\n<div>\n                                    Question #: 284<br/>\n                                    Topic #: 1\n                                </div>\n<a class=\"all-questions-link\" href=\"/exams/amazon/aws-sysops/\">\n                                    [All AWS-SysOps Questions]\n                                </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"question-body mt-3 pt-3 border-top\" data-id=\"704786\">\n<p class=\"card-text\">A user is planning to scale up an application by 8 AM and scale down by 7 PM daily using Auto Scaling.
